Mom keeps talking about the divorce. She seems unable to accept the simple belief that everyone is doing the best they can and want a sustainable family relationship in the end. She only seems to be able to place blame on Dad for not agreeing to the original process. She seems unable to accept that circumstances might've changed to warrant his change in behaviour. The only blame of her own that she believes is that she created this current situation by leaving. Not that any other of her behaviours contribute this. That seems absurd that she cannot understand or take responsibility for her role. 

These are the simple unegotiable truths:
- This is an emotionally charged situation.
- Mom and Dad have the most control over this situation. 
- Mom and Dad both contributed to the current state of events. 

They should consider how they might be wrong before making assumptions about each other and other people. 

Mom has been using Lindsey and my emotions as leverage to weaponize us against Dad, so that the resolution ends quickly. She understood her actions as fair and just. But are they? 

Now, she's using language that we're "silencing" her. Let's break that down. I am silencing her from talking about the divorce. Rather than silencing, I've told her she cannot come to me for support with that and emphasized those that she can talk to about such matters. Would she view it as "silencing" if I phrased it in a way that I am too emotionally charged for us to talk about this? that I don't have the emotional space to support her in this?

I'm putting up boundaries that I didn't know I could put up. She told me about their fights. She asked about chosing custody between her and Dad. She told me when she cheated on Dad. And when she talked to other men. 

We may be adults now. But there are some boundaries that are needed. Human beings make mistakes. People might behave differently if they could have but you weren't capable at that time. Everyone is frustratated and trying to find security and happiness in their own ways.
