title: marathon not a sprint

I've been training for a marathon. Well, I wasn't training for a marathon - but I've been doing the training program for people who are training for a marathon.

My goal was to be able to 20km (almost a proper half marathon is 21.1km) every few weeks, like I previously did with 7km or 10km runs.

Yet, almost 11 weeks into the program, I've run about 300km. And I've run three half marathons - two of them in the past two weeks.

This is way more running than I thought I'd ever do. I planned on doing half the program as I only wanted to be able to run a half marathons every few weeks.

This past week, a few days before my third half marathon, I'd been thinking about continuing with the program - getting all the way to 42km, a proper marathon. I hadn't been happy with my times and I wanted to train harder.

And on my third half marathon this week, I did. I ran my fastest half marathon and cut 20s off my average km pace. I came back with the usual aches, pains, dehydration, blisters, and something new - a blood blister.

Running far is a weird thing. I feel the exhaustaion, the pain, the hurt. I forget about it for a bit and adjust to the pain and endurance that's required of me. Then, in the last few kilometers, I want to stop running so badly - and I can - but I don't. I decide to keep running the full distance. Even though, I know I can stop at any point. But, I decide to put myself through this experience. And it's grueling, it's hard and it hurts. 

At any point, I can call it. It's my choice and it's complete within my control and I don't.

Because, it's growth, baby. And that growth, that strength makes me feel unstoppable. 

I'm training myself to be unstoppable and starting with controlling by own thoughts. Because on hard running days, my thoughts are not super positive thoughts. My thoughts drift to think about my tired legs, my tense arms, or my sore feet. "When will it be over?" 

And those aren't marathon thoughts - those are sprint thoughts. And baby, I'm running a marathon.

I don't want my thoughts to be "when will it be over", "just a little bit longer", "just fight the pain".

I want my thoughts to focus on hope, possibility, and self-compassion when I'm running. I want them to focus on the strength I've already demonstrated. I want them to fill me up with "I got this", "yes legs", "this is why I've been training", "you're out here", "you're doing this" thoughts.

If I'm able to think these thoughts when I'm running, in one of the hardest things I've ever done, then that's how I'll talk to myself on easier days too.

So yes, I want to run a full marathon. And yes, I'm going to keep doing the training program. 

But, I am taking a day off because I don't want to rush through this program. I'm not here for the one-liner of "I ran a marathon". I'm here because it's the ultimate way to be filled with hope, possibility, and compassion - even on my hardest days - to be my own champion.

This means that I'm taking a few rest days. Because I don't want to be focused on the finish line - I don't want those sprint thoughts. I want those marathon thoughts. I want to enjoy this marathon - the whole journey, training and all.

So today is the first time that I've taken two consistent days off running since starting this program 11 weeks ago. And over these last 11 weeks, I've run faster and harder than I ever have in my life. 

And when my body and my mind are ready, I'll get back out there and I know I got this because I'm already doing it.
