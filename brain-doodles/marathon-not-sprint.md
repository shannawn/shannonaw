title: marathon not a sprint

I've been training for a marathon. Well, I'm not training for a marathon - but I'm doing the training program for people who are training to run a marathon.

My goal was to be able to 20km (almost a proper half marathon is 21.1km) every few weeks, like I used to do with 7km or 10km runs.

Yet, almost 11 weeks later, I've run about 300km. I've run three half marathons - two of them in the past two weeks.

This is way more running than I thought I'd do when I started this training program. I planned on only doing half the program - which is about where I am in the program. I only wanted to be able to run a half marathons every few weeks.

This past week a few days before my third half marathon, I'd been thinking about continuing with the program - getting all the way to 42km, a proper marathon. I hadn't been happy with my times and I wanted to train harder.

And on my third half marathon this week, I did. I ran my fastest half marathon and cut 20s off my average km pace. And I came back with the usual aches, pains, dehydration, blisters, and something new - a blood blister.

Running far is a weird thing. I feel the exhaustaion, the pain, the hurt. I start to feel the pain and exhausation at the halfway point and then I forget about it for a bit. I adjust to the pain and endurance that's required of me. Then, at the last few kilometers, I want to stop running the last few kilometers so badly - and I can - but I don't. 

The weird thing about deciding to put myself through this experience is it's grueling, it's hard and it hurts. Yet, I know I can stop at any point. At any point, I can call it. It's my choice and it's complete within my control and I don't.

Because, it's growth, baby. And that growth, that strength makes me feel unstoppable. 

It's training me to control my thoughts. Admitly, on most days, not super positive thoughts. My thoughts drift to think about my tired legs, my tense arms, or my sore feet. "When will it be over?" 

But those are spring thoughts. And when it's literally a marathon, I have to change my thoughts.

It's not "when will it be over", "just a little bit longer", "just fight the pain".

It's about focusing on the hope, possibility, and self-compassion that I've already demonstrated. It's "I got this", "yes legs", "this is why I've been training", "you're doing this".

And this is what I want to be thinking about when I'm running. If I'm thinking about how unbelievable it is that I'm out there, then whenever any challenges of any kind come in my life, that's how I'll talk to myself.

So yes, I want to run a full marathon. And yes, I'm going to keep doing the training program. But, I am taking a day off because I don't want to rush through this program. The one-liner of "I ran a marathon" isn't why I'm here. I'm here doing this marathon because it's the ultimate way to control my self-talk - to be my own champion.

And if I'm doing this out of hope, possibility, and self-compassion, then taking a few rest days is not only okay, but recommended. I don't need to worry about the fear of not getting back out there, or not completing the program. I'm choosing to be slow because I know I can run this marathon and I want to enjoy it. I want to be able to relish in my strength while I'm running it. And in order to do that, I'm taking a few rest days. These two days have been my first two consistent days without running in the last 11 weeks. And over these last 11 weeks, I've run faster and harder than I ever have in my life. 

So, tomorrow, if my body and my mind are ready, we'll get back out there - but today is a rest day.
