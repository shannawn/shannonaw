title: work as donations

In the last week, Nick and I both tested positive for COVID. It was determined that Nanny Lane Engineering would now be managed by Emir. 

My expereince at CareGuide over the last week has reminded me that everything that you give to a product and a team is ultimately theirs - not yours. 

It's not under your control or ownership. Your work, dedication, and effort is a donation. So how much are you willing to donate?

How much of a donation of your blood, sweat, and tears is worth your salary? Maybe none.

I've valued so much of my worth in work. With the pandemic, those boundaries became even less clear. But that's because capitalism has taught us that we're not enough - that we become enough through working more - earning it. 

What would the world be like if our worth was inherit to us? We wouldn't have anything to prove. We might only want to meet rather than exceed expectations. We'd tell them when we're too overworked and emotionally exhausted to meet their expectations. 

If I viewed work as a donation, how much do I want to donate this month? What's the budget? Let's not go over that. 

7 hours a day with breaks. Each day, I feel like I still have gas in the tank, at least 75%. I set reasonable goals rather than striving goals. It's okay if it gets done tomorrow, or next week.

What would work look like if I lived a life with clarity and an openheart?

I'm clear about what's serving me and what's not. I know that hope and possibility serve me much better than insecurity, anxiety, or control. I'm clear about what I can accomplish and what I need to delegate or deprioritize. I share those learnings with others. I ask for help when I need it. 

I'm willing to believe that others have good intentions. I understand that people are whole people and that I only see a slice of them. I'm committed to the shared goal of the team, rather than my own ambitions or opinions. I understand that I need to be open to learning about myself and how I might be wrong and how I might be right.
