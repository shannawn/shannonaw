Last weekend, Nick and I went on a trip down the Cape Peninsula. We drove all the way down the coast to the most Southwestern tip of the continent.

On the tour, we stopped at Bo Kapp where Nick and I did the Cape Malay cooking class earlier in our time in Cape Town. These are people who were taken from Malaysia to become slaves along with Indonesians, Indians, and people from other African countries. Those from Southeast Asia (incl. India) created Cape Malay cuisine. It has everything from samosas to sambal (which can be anything from a chili paste to a salad involving fruits and veggies that go with samosas) to koeksisters (a fried ball of dough with cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, cardamom with coconut sprinkles on top). We started the day with some samosas and a koeksister.

Then, we drove along the coast stopping at different viewpoints along the way. Eventually, we got to Hout Bay (Nick and I actually biked here earlier in our time in Cape Town). In a small harbour, we got on a ship that would take us out to Duiker Island (also known as Seal Island). 

Before we even left the harbour, there were seals in the water and locals were feeding the seals fish to try and get them up on the harbourfront. I was getting pretty excited watching the seals, so we moved up to the front of the boat. Out of the bay, the waves were rocky. The whole boat was moving with them. As the waves picked up knocking some of us over, the island came into sight. Hundreds of Cape fur seals on the island and in the water. Seals of all ages. 

Some larger ones on the island and lots of younger ones doing flips in the water. The young ones are incredibly playful. 

On the islands, most of the seals were relaxing on the rocks but some were fighting with each other - kinda banging their "chests" together. When they're fighting, they almost sound like a low roar. 

Watching a seal run up a rock from the water is hilarious. It's almost like they're doing the dance move the "worm" to get distance.

As we drove down the Peninsula, we also saw baboons and ostriches! Baboons were walking across the roads and the walking trails down by Cape of Good Hope. The ostriches were doing the same and blocking traffic. We also passed an ostrich farm.

Ostriches are so unique! Their neck almost looks like another one of their legs. Their necks can reach the ground. We even saw one scratch its neck with its foot (or its foot with its neck?). Part of their uniqueness is their size. It's unusual to see an animal of that size without arms! 

At the Cape of Good Hope, we got to visit the most southwestern tip of Africa. Looking out into the ocean and realizing that the next land mass that we'd hit would be Antartica is pretty astounding. The fact that two Canadians could reach this point on Earth, so far away from home reminds me how unbelievably large the world is and the wonders of air travel.

Then last but not least, we saw African penguins! They're quite small - only about 2 ft tall. When there's lots of penguins on land, they're called a waddle! And they waddle just as adorably as you would've imagined. 

If you look closely, they have a small pink gland above each eye. It helps them cope with high temperatures. Blood is sent to the glands where it is cooled by the surrounding air, and keeps the animal cooler. The glands get pinker the hotter it gets.

They don't interact much between each other - except for the occasional territorial interaction. But they have waddles because they hunt in groups. But most of the penguins we saw were caring for their babies (the lighter coloured penguins). They have burrows around the beach to protect themselves from the sun.

They swim in and out of the water in a semi-abrupt way - kinda like how we get out of the ocean in wavy periods. They try to wait for a wave to ride in and sometimes, it's more graceful than others. In the water, they're pretty fast, about 20 km per hour!

Occasionally, they "bray" which is a loud donkey-like sound. For this, they've been not-so-affectionately-nicknamed "jackass penguins".
