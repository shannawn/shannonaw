title: Medicalizing Infertility

The medicalization of infertility has increased the use of assisted reproductive technologies beyond their intended population by focusing on those involved in gamete donation, surrogacy, and in vitro fertilization. Assisted reproductive technologies are not only used by women who experience infertility to help them carry their biological child through term, but it also involves the use of these technologies on fertile populations. 
Through the use of these technologies on the fertile population, infertile women are able to achieve the goal of a successful pregnancy. For example, in gamete donation where one of partners experiences infertility, two other fertile people must use assisted reproductive technologies in order to achieve the goal of a successful pregnancy for the infertile woman. The woman experiencing infertility requires the eggs of a fertile woman and the sperm of a fertile man to be fertilized through in vitro fertilization, it is then transferred to the infertile woman. While, in surrogacy, the infertile woman requires a fertile man to donate their sperm, a fertile woman to donate their eggs, and the fertile woman who will become surrogacy to undergo in vitro fertilization. In both of these examples, to cure a womanâ€™s infertility, assisted reproductive technologies must be applied to at least one fertile person and in doing so, it expands the treatment from an intended population (that of the infertile) to that of the fertile.
