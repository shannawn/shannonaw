I'm sitting on the dock in Muskoka watching the morning fog spreads over the lake. Watching the movement and progression of the fog across lake reminds me of the movement and progression within myself. Today marks the first full day of being a digital nomad. And with it comes the inherent precarity and the opportunity to find and create a locus of stability within myself -egardless of where I am. It almost seems like the ultimate meditation - cities, homes, landscapes become a passing experience and I have the choice to weave them into the fabric of myself. 

It brings an opportunity to restitch the social fabric of my life - how can I support my loved ones virtually? Intentionally and with that intention, I may even be a better, more thoughtful, connected daughter, friend, and sister. 

As I move forward, who do I want to become? How can I embody and live my values?
