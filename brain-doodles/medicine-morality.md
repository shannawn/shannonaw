title: Medicine and Morality

Structural violence governs all the systems and processes of our global society. It manifests itself in political, health, economic, and social processes where structural inequality prevents people from meeting their basic needs. Structural violence creates many injustices and calls no one to blame. It asks us to question our everyday taken-for-granted patterns into questions and asks questions about justice and morality. 

At such a global scale of injustice, it reminds me of the words of Peter Singer. He asks individuals to look at their moral responsibility in global poverty by creating a thought experiment: 

> There is a small child drowning in a shallow pond with only you in the area to help. Would you help? Of course, you're obligated to help this child, despite the fact that it might cost you something (time, ruining your favorite clothes, etc.). 

How is structural violence any different? 
> If there were 5 children drowning in a shallow pond with only you in the area to help. Would you help? Yes.

> If there were 50? You'd try.

How come the greater injustice, the greater structure the more removed our moral obligation feels? 

> Perhaps, moral obligation also needs hope. Hope that we can help the situation. And the more children, the less hopeful we become.

With structural violence, we're called to understand our everyday taken-for-granted patterns of society and what has created them.

## History of Medicine

Today, most people understand medicine as objective. But similar to how we view artifical intelligence as a computer with biases because of the engineers that built it, same is true with medicine. Each scientist that has come along their own ideas, assumptions, and biases. Each scientist has decided what is important, how much time they should spend researching any given idea, and what assumptions we can make. And of course, the biases they hold that are unknown.

Our ideas, assumptions, and biases are shaped by our social environments. As religion was prominent, most believed that God was punishing someone. Altering the body was seen as tampering with God's will. 

As secular thinking became popular, Rene Decartes theory of mind-body dualism where mind, body, and soul were separated opened the doors to scientific thought that we know today.

However, definitions of illness and disease shifted through time because our scientific observations are made through socially constructed processes. An obvious example is homosexuality.

We developed our knowledge of medicine by studying cadavers. And because of purity culture, we didn't study female cadavers. It was "impure" to look at female body that wasn't your wife. The male body became the human body. And the basis for health care.

With limited ways to access the body and perform diagnostics, early medicine used to rely on the experiences of the patient. They would need to be detailed in their experiences to help the doctors uncover what might be happening.

## Challenges in Medicine

### Ignoring Social Structures

Today, we rely on a biomedical understanding of health and illness. It focuses on the diagnosis and explanation of illness as a malfunction of biological mechanisms. In biomedicine, the body is treated like a machine - made up of individual parts that fit together and function like clockwork, all of them interdependent. This focuses on the inner working of the body and treating individuals failing to acknowledge any non-medical factors that influenced the disease origin or prevention. We know that there are non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. More important than lifestyle choices is the social determinants of health. These include daily living conditions including housing and amenities, food security, income, employment, discrimination, education, and much more.

### Isolated on the Body

A biomedical understanding of disease looks for the organic origins and malfunction to understand a disease. But illness is not just physical. It impacts more than just someone's body. Illness modifies the perception of our body, values, and world (e.g. understanding that our physical incapabilities feel like insults, render us in our most fetal state). Our biomedical understanding, removes the human lived experienced. It assumes that illness and disease are experienced by active subjects not passive biomedical bodies. This is challenged with phenomenology where they look at the first-person account of illness.

Even getting a diagnosis from a medical professional depends on more than just your physical body, but your behaviours. There is a sick role that those experiencing illness are expecting to take. The most important being that they are trying to get better. However, many medical professionals have biases and stereotypes for different sexes, genders, race, and ages causing them to take the patient accounts of very specific symptoms and patients seriously.

## Overmedicalized

Biomedicine contributes to overmedicalization of life through clinical, and social iatrogenesis.

Clinical iatrogenesis occurs when medical treatment causes additional bodily damage. We view pills as targeted medicine with small side effects on your body. We take a pill for a headache, believing it has no impact on other systems in our body. Unlike pills, we view drugs as changing our entire experience - from how we experience the world, to how our body functions. Thereâ€™s uncertainty with not knowing how it will impact you, your behaviour, or your mind in the short or long term.

Social iatrogenesis occurs when people become consumers of curative, preventive, industrial and environmental medicine. You can think of it as the medicalization of ordinary processes or ailments of life into medical phenomena. An ordinary process that is often medicalized with treatment is baldness. Another example of curative and preventive medicines are often in vitamins but also in conceptualizing risk as a disease. We often hear conversations about high cholestrol or osteoprosis. High chlorestrol might later lead to a heart disease but isn't a heart disease. Osteoprosis is reduced bone mass, but factures are less than 3% likely to occur. This is also called disease mongering. It can be used to widen the boundaries of treatable illness in order to expand markets for those who sell and deliver treatments.

## Capitalism in Medicine

Whether it's pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, or individual medical professionals, capitalism is present in all social structures including medicine. The commodification of medicine manifests itself in price, cost, quality, availability, and distribution. Pharmaceuticals determine the price of a treatment, its availability, and market it to medical professionals as well as patients (now viewed as consumers). Medicine is riddled with need creation ploys and aims to develop treatments that require long-term usage. Insurance companies determine who and what counts as medical care actings as gates to accessibility.

There are very few people who have the right access to the right drugs for the right amount of time (assuming they've gotten a proper diagnosis, etc) when health as a desirable outcome to be obtained through purchase, rather than a moral need.

## Sex in Medicine

There is limited knowledge on diseases almost exclusively experienced by women, diseases where women are disportionately affected and on diseases that show up differently in women.

Diseases almost exclusively experienced by women are often called bikini medicine covering all the body parts that a bikini does. This is where most of medical research and funding that impacts women is spent.

Diseases that disproprotionately affect women (like migraines) or ones that show up differently in women (like heart disease) are often underfunded compared to how many people suffer from them. This underfunding means that we have a knowledge gap in medicine about health issues and bodies of women broadly. This knowledge gaps means that it's harder for medical professionals to properly diagnose women. If they listen to their account of their symptoms, it's hard to be sure what symptoms correlate to which disease. But most medical professionals don't trust women's account for the symptoms and view them as unreliable reporters. This is due to a long history of hysteria and psychosomatic diseases. For centuries, medical professionals believed all of women's health issues stemmed from their uterus and everything else was a figment of their imagination. Because of this, medical professionals have a very specific sick role that women should play and women often don't play it correctly to get proper medical attention. They're either too much of a hypochrondiac or don't seem to be in enough pain to justify their visit. 

The knowledge gap creates a trust gap that goes both ways: medical professionals don't trust women as reliable reporters and women don't trust medical professionals because they never believe them. This then deters women from visiting medical professionals and participating in research to help lessen the knowledge gap. The treatment that women experience with medical professionals that changes their illness beliefs - if the severity and nature of our symptoms our serious enough to warrant medical attention.

Today, we know so little about the women's bodies. Often women's health is assumed to be the same as men's health except for our reproductive organs. But the body is a dynamic, evolving environment that looks different down to the cell. Women's bodies are far more complex in almost every bodily system. Especially in the systems that govern our entire body like our immune and endocrine systems. Our immune system needs to know how to decide whether or not to attack or nourish an living organism feeding off of our body - as these could look like pathogens or a fetus. Our endocrine system acts as a messenger throughout our entire body that uses our hormones to guide our thoughts, needs, and behaviours. Our hormonal cycles that prepare our uteruses for eggs and pregnancy have a higher level of hormone variation at any given point in the cycle. These hormonal cycle influences the complexity of our bodies' main messenger - the endocrine system. Bodies with testes don't require this level of nuance because their biological, evolutionary purpose is not to grow life.

In research, we exclude women for many reasons. 

Medical research is more expensive when there are women subjects because it takes more time to make sure that all women are at the same part of their cycle. 

Women trying for a baby, pregnant, or breastfeeding aren't allowed to participate in medical research - even though most women are in one of these cycles for a large part of their life and during that period, doctors still prescribe them drugs. We seem to try to protect pregnant people *from* research rather than *with* research.

If women are included in a study, it's often not in a large enough numbers to be able to make statistically significant claims about the impacts of the findings.

We need more research on women's bodies and better training for medical professionals. Women aren't the only community that experiences these injustices - in fact, most people aren't the body that medicine used to make most of it's claims.
