title: human != male

Tonight, I attended an informational session today by the Reproductive Health Access Project. 

Something struck me. Medical professionals don't need to understand or practice health for people with uteruses. It's not required learning. They do not need to learn how about reproductive health. They don't need to learn about supporting and delivering contraceptives, abortion, or miscarriage care. 

It's an optional not required learning or practice. That means that medical professionals today do not have a comprehensive understanding of more than 50% of the population - those of the population who have uteruses.

It reminds me of a quote by Simone de Beauvoir "Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female â€“ whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male."

Our bodies are not defined as human because our health is not defined as health. Our bodies and our health are optional. 

Our bodies are only relevant as they relate to bodies with testes. Our health only matters as long as it serves the greater purpose of bodies with testes. 

Medical professionals assume our bodies are the same as bodies with testes. And by assuming they're the same, they ignore that being human is not defined by any sex or any gender. 

The assumption that the human body is a body with testes creates the need for people with uteruses to be our own medical advocate - to turn to the internet of self-diagnosis and self-administered drugs before medical professionals - because even when we do share our concerns, most medical professionals don't know how to view them as legitimate or treat them. They were never taught about how different bodies might manifest diseases differently. Bodies with testes might show different symptoms than bodies with uteruses. But medical professionals don't know what those symptoms are. 

Because of this, our access to health is limited.

We need to change this. Every body deserves access to health.
