Where is the self?

It's easy for me to live my life without recognizing the role I play in creating those days.

It's kinda like walking into a room and seeing a floating kettle pouring tea into a cup, a pan frying an egg, and dishes setting the table. 

It sounds magical. But now imagine, there are actually people moving these objects - someone is pour the tea, frying the egg, and setting the table. The people moving these objects wouldn't feel very appreciated. They might even forget the exist, forget to take up space, forget to be grateful for themselves.

This is sometimes how I feel in my life. I focus on what's going on outside of me, rather than my role in making it happen. 

I'd be grateful for getting into Oxford - while not recognizing my dedication in writing my personal statements, my determination in getting the required documents, and my bravery to try something new.

I'd be grateful for swimming across the lake - while not recognizing my courage to try to swim across the lake, my curiosity to explore my strength, and my strength and determination for ensuring I succeed. 

I want to reintroduce the self into my life. I want my own appreciation and recognition for who I am.

Because I'm not only grateful for the life I have today but who and how it was created. And who continues to imagine a true and beautiful life for me and creates it. 

 in my one, precious, wild life.
