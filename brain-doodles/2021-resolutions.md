title: 2021 resolutions - and yet she is
---
Today, I choose to let love win. 

I am brave in this pursuit. I feel my emotions and create the space to follow them. In following them, I discover unmet needs and find clarity within myself. I share these needs with others and choose thoughts, beliefs, and actions that serve them. 

And I let go of those that do not because I know the difference between pain and suffering. I imagine who I'd be without them and become her. I impress myself and relish in that pride.

I allow myself to be slow because I trust myself and my abilities. I know that when I try my best, it's better than I ever could've imagined. 

Because I am as soft as I am strong, I keep my heart open and strengthen the muscles around it. I always want to be able to recieve the curiosity and gratitude that each moments holds as I've never seen one like it before. â™¡
