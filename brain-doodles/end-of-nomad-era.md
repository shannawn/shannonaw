title: end of nomading (for now)
date: Sept 1 2022

Today is the day. We're moving to Oxford. We will have a permanent address. 18 Empress Court, Woodins Way, Oxford.

After 711 days, 68 homes, 57 new cities, 11 countries, and 3 continents, I'll miss it.

I became a nomad because I wanted to leave Toronto, but didn't have a strong idea of where I wanted to go. I just knew I wanted it to be different. Not having a clear idea of where I wanted to go made the decision so hard.

I was lucky enough to know someone who had already been living in new places for short periods. Whenever he updated me on his nomadic lifestyle while we was travelling South America, I remember thinking I could never do that. All the logistics. All the moving. That'd be exhausting.

I wouldn't have guessed that I'd try it myself, let alone, like it enough to do it for two years.

You gain a lot when you become a nomad. In the romanticized version, it stimultaenously holds the excitement of a never-ending adventure and the relaxation of a non-stop vacation. 

But in reality, it's neither. It's a mix of handling a copious amount of logistics while trying to make the most of the place you're living in. 

Being a nomad is an easy lifestyle to romanticize. Travelling to new countries, meeting new people, exploring new places and cultures. But it's also only sustainable when we do it at a pace where we can handle all the messy parts. Finding a home that's within our budget and accessible, navigating travel logistics, researching passport regulations. We spend probably just as much time going on adventures as researching the next spot. No matter how much planning or researching we'd do, there's always the unknown. That's the fun part of it. But also exhausting part.

It's an extraordinary way to experience the world and learn more about yourself. It's hard to believe all the places we've seen and all the challenges we've experienced. It often feels surreal when I think about it. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and forget that you're running in Africa, for example. 

I'll always remember our Canadian travels as the easiest and Morocco and Namibia as some of the more challenging. The more comfortable the location, the more you're able to focus on the beauty of place and people you're with. The more challening the location, the more you learn. Over the last two years, we've managed to find a good balance of both.

Moving into Oxford marks the beginning of a transition. We've moved into lots of homes over the last two years. But this is different. The flat might be furnished but it's not _as_ furnished as an Airbnb. We'll need to buy things and _own_ things. Usually, we're quite hesititant to buy and own anything. As soon as you own it, it becomes something you travel with indefinitely. You'll unpack it and re-pack it at every stop. 

Over the last year, we've treated our homes as something borrowed rather than owned. It gave us freedom. No place was perfect and it didn't have to be. It just had to be "good enough" for us. If there were problems, they weren't ours to fix. We could view it as a quirk. If they didn't have something that we wanted, we'd buy it and leave it behind for the next guests.

At Oxford, we're shameless in buying the _right_ things to make our stay more enjoyable. Whether it's nice knives, patio furniture, etc, it's worth it in the long-term. But we're definitely feeling the pain of ownership already. There are so many costs upfront to set up a home.

It marks the beginning of new routines. Moving into new places and homes provides new opportunities to change habits. Some homes have better biking paths, so we bike more. Others have better patios, so we eat outside more. The biggest changes in our routines didn't come from the Airbnb, but the timezone. On the West Coast, we started work early and got to have lots of afternoon adventures that blurred into the evenings. In Europe and Africa, our adventures were in the morning and then we worked into the night.

It'll be harder to start new routines and habits without as clear markers of time. But it'll much easier to keep the good ones. 

It marks the beginning of a new relationship with Nick and I. We'll go from being each other's whole worlds to experiencing more alone and sharing it with each other later. For the last two years, especially in the places where I've felt less safe, we've done almost everything together: travelling, exploring, working, biking, cooking, etc. With everything else around us changing, we've become each other's constants.

At Oxford, we'll be able to forge new relationships and experiences and then come together to share them with each other. I'm excited to be able to learn from him in new ways as our environment changes. 

The biggest change isn't the activities of our lives but the frequency. We'll still discover new neighbourhoods, meet new people from different places, take long flights or trains, and stay in Airbnbs. Just not as often. 

We'll miss lots of perks of being a digital nomad but we're so excited for all the perks of living in one spot.

We'll be able to bake, get a good night's sleep with a guaranteed good pillow, grow plants, build a community that you can see often, shop online comfortably knowing that you'll be there when it's delivered, and so much more. We'll be able to go on a trip and come back to home without needing to move-in. We'll be able to buy baking supplies because we'll be in one spot long enough to use them. We'll become plant parents because we won't need to leave it behind when we go to the next house. We'll be able to chat with people at the farmer's markets because they'll recognize us from our other visits. We'll be able to join communities based on sports or hobbies because we won't be leaving in a week or two. We'll be able to find running and biking routes that we do so often where we won't need to follow a map on our phones. And so much more.
