I've always wanted to be smart. And the funny thing is I'm not even sure I know what smart is. I've been striving to reach something that I don't even know what it looks like when I get there. 

What is being smart? Is it remembering random historical facts? Is it convincing people you know a lot? Is it having interesting thoughts? What does being smart actually even mean. 

In school, they taught us being smart was a memorization game. To get the A+ on the test, we had to memorize all the answers. As we got older, it become more and more about memorization. We'd have multiple choice questions with games in them. They'd start to try to trick us into selecting the wrong option. So is being smart out-smarting the other side? But what does that even mean? Like I don't know what smart means, so I also don't know what out-smarting someone means.

I think a bunch of people taught us a lot of bullshit about being smart because they didn't know what it meant either. I mean we got so desperate we started coming up with different types of smarts. We call some people book smart and others street smart. Like does it matter which specific smart you are, or can we be a little more generous here and call everyone smart?

As I kid, I remember thinking I was only book smart. I could get good grades but like I honestly believed I wasn't a smart thinker. Like being street smart meant that you could make your way out of tough situations. While, being book smart meant that you could con the school system. 

Imagine growing up and believing you're actually *bad* at thinking. Like the fucking basic human existence. I think, therefore I am - but telling yourself, I think bad, therefore I don't know if I am? or I think bad, therefore I am bad?

This has fucked me up more than I'd like to admit. 

Having two parents as professors, I needed to be smart. Everyone expected me to be. If someone asked what my parents did, their expectations for me being smart went through the roof. 

At the same time, being girl, people think you're all emotions and therefore, not smart. But, people also expect girls to be way more studious than boys. So it's like we're not smart, but we study harder? And when we get older, they then think we're less competent than men after telling us we mature faster. It doesn't make sense. If we are more studious, then we should be smarter and because we mature faster, we should be EVEN smarter than that.

So now, after 25 years, I'm trying to figure out if I am smart, what the fuck smart means to me, and if I care. Maybe I should start to with what smart means, if I care, and then if I meet that definition.

Here we go. Right now, I think being smart means having interesting thoughts. The interesting thought doesn't need to be an original thought. Can you be smart if you're just thinking about other people's interesting thoughts? If you apply them to new situations or add slight nuance, then yeah - so maybe it has to be new, interesting thoughts. 

I think to be smart, you always have to be able to explain your thoughts to others.  And those people have to react to them in some way - not eye rolling but engage with it. So maybe being smart needs external validation. 

If someone just had interesting thoughts and never shared them, are they smart? Yes. I think? 

So does smart literally just mean having new thoughts? And don't we all do that probably all the time? Every single fucking human lives in a unique environment with unique challenges and experiences. And yes, of course, there's still the shared human experience. But, odds are everyone has had a new, interesting thought at least once. And if you have one new, interesting thought in your life, is that enough to be smart? Probably. Might depend on the thought - but yeah. 

..But what does smart mean to me? I don't think I really relate to the solo thinker who never shares their thoughts. Or to the person that has one, big, great new thought. 

I think for me, why I care about being smart is because being smart is saying something to someone that helps them. Helping them might mean they think about something in a new way or offers comfort. For me, I think being smart is having a thought that can help someone and then, being brave enough to share it with them. When you share, I think they need to understand it. So being smart means being comfortable enough with your own thoughts that you can share them with someone else and they can understand. 

All in all, I think I am smart. And I'm excited to gain confidence and a deep knowing that I'm smart. To help me do that, I've invested a thousand dollars in myself. It's money that make me become more comfortable with my thoughts. It's money that will help me share my thoughts in a way that people can understand. And it's money that will help me be brave in sharing those thoughts.
