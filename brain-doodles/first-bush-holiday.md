title: First bush holiday
date: June 29 2022

Nick and I just got back from our 4-night safari in Greater Kruger Park. From Cape Town, we took a flight to Johannesburg and then drove for about 6 hours.

The locals call safaris "bush holidays". They joke that it's a special type of holiday where you come back more tired than when you left. Each day starts at 5:30am and ends around 10:30pm. In between, there's about two 3.5hr drives to see the animals. Nick and I got into the habit of napping between the first and the second.

We stayed in treehouses, where we could see animals from our balcony and listen to them at night. We heard impala (a type of antelope) fighting that almost sounded like a lion. And actual lions calling to each other.

The best part of the trip was seeing the animals interact with each other and us. Lots of people talk about the "Big 5" (lions, rhinos, leopards, elephants, water buffalo). In Kruger, most people get to see all of them. Well, except the leopard which they nicknamed "the elusive one". Most of the guides will tell you that it's not about seeing them or catching a glimpse of them - but watching them interact. It is so intimate to watch them in the wild. We get to see the intimate moments like...

An older female elephant scratching itself on a tree and eating the leaves from a tree, a mother elephant teaching its baby how to eat the red bark of a tree, and a baby elephant trying to play with itself when there's no playmates around. 

The young lion cubs jump on one of the dominant male lions' tails, the moms breastfeeding the cubs, and the lions calling to each other. 

A giraffe using its tongue to clean a branch of its leaves. 

An impala standing still and then leaping away when it worries about a predator close by. 

An eagle owl sitting in a tree enjoying its night catch - a guinea fowl. 

The vervet monkeys sitting on a tree taunting a hyena as the others clean each other. 

A hyena calling to each other as they start their hunt for dinner - with surprisingly long necks!

The details of male waterbock's antlers and how they jump through the water away from any predators. 

The swooping of the hornbills as they watch out for the drama below. 

The fast movement of their legs of the spurfowl as they hide through the grasslands and forget they can fly. 

The most vibrant colours of the lilac breasted roller. 

The sheer size and density of the water buffalo. 

The dwarf mongoose coming in and out of the holes they built in the termite hill to warm up in the sun. 

The speed that bushbabies jump through the trees at night. 

The tiny horns budding on male stambock popping up above the grass as it jumps. 

As you go through the pictures, here are a few of the interesting facts we learned from the guides...

When female lions are in heat, male lions try not to let them out of their sight so they can mate. However, the female lions are trying to attract the other males in the pride. This way when the cub is born no one knows who the dad is which lets the cubs stay in the pride for longer. The female lions also mother collectively from breastfeeding to everything else, so that if one of them dies, the cubs can still survive. 

Most of the time hippos just stand in water or walk across it. They rarely swim. Many hippos are called a bloat of hippos. 

Elephants only eat leaves and twigs. They eat a ridiculous amount of this a day to fuel their bodies. They also don't have great digestion systems. For the food they eat, they only absorb about 40% of the nutrients. This means that lots of animals eat their dung to get the extra nutrients. They eat so much wood that they're dung looks really similar to plywood. 

Nick and I loved it so much that we're already looking into more safaris.
