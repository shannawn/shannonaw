I've been reading a book that talks about European civilization and how it had "progressed" further than other regions like sub-Saharan Africans, Indigenous people of the Americas, Aboriginal Australians, New Guineans. The main thesis is that it was due to environmental and geographic advantages than any biological genius.

Hunter-gatherer societies require most (if not all) of their time to be dedicated to procuring food to be fully nourished. Europeans had access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that made it easy store and offered high nourishment for little work. Further with access to domesticable animals that are easily bred in captivity, they were able to create food surpluses. (Most other continents either had indomesticable animals or had a mass-extinction event eliminating most of the megafauna once humans arrived animals didn't know to be afraid of humans for hunting and natural accidents like fires. Unlike continents like Africa where animals and human evolved alongside and animals knew to fear humans but were largely indomesticable). And because the continent exists latitudinally over longitudinally, it made easier to regrow the same crops as they moved throughout the continent. 

Once they had enough food for everyone, then people could start to specialize and create innovations with the extra time they had.

With more food, also came increased populations. More people could live for longer and start families which lead necessitated them to move across the continent and create denser cities. These denser cities had lots of people and lots of animals which meant that disease spread quickly and those that didn't die, grew immunity. 

With many natural borders like mountains and rivers, many communities were created with smaller empires which forced innovation to be able to conquer others in warfare. As competitors were their close neighbours.

In the past few days, we flew from Namibia to the Netherlands. It struck us how wealthy the Netherlands is compared to Namibia. In absolutely every aspect from roads, to houses, trains, buses, and people. Both in infrastructure but also in individual wealth. 

Nations create ceilings and floors for their citizens. A Dutch person of any wealth will have access to impeccable cycle paths, walking trails, health care, and education (of a certain quality). While in Namibia, the only guarantee is primary education (of another quality). If they live in a township, power and running water might be in question. If they're in South Africa, consistent power is unlikely with various load shedding efforts.

This means that the wealthiest Namibian will likely have less opportunity than the poorest Dutch person. This sounds a little bleak and with increased globalization, maybe there is room for more opportunity for cross-border interactions and growth. But that wealthy Namibian would need to have enough money to get a flight to the Netherlands to begin with and might only lead to further brain drain. 

What would it take to actively spread wealth and learn from today's civilizations strengths and weaknesses?

It's the little details in the differences that become obvious
