title: parents are just children

I'm noticing that I'm being triggered. I'm being triggered where two adults of incapable of solving their own issues and Mom asks for help from their children and Dad ignores the state of the world. 

They've both pitched each other on what's reasonable. Great - but did so in isolation. This needs to be co-created. This should be simple for them. It's what they do for work, but they seem unable to do this.

It's going to be 14 months since Dad moved out. 16 months since the separation. It's time for it to be resolved. There will always be things in your life that make this hard. It's a hard thing. But there's never going to be a perfect time. At this point, the only next right thing is to creating "fairness" in isolation and discuss it with each other. Determine what your individual goals are and ask your laywers for support. They do this for living. Lindsey and I do not. 

I'm disappointed that this has gone on so long and that they both just point fingers at each other. No one seems to be taking accountability. 

At this point, I've set clear boundaries: I only want status updates without emotion involved, either: you're negotiating more or you're finalizing an agreement. 

Is this involvement is serving me? Fuck no.
Is this something I can change? Nope.

Then, this shouldn't be an area I'm putting my energy towards.
