We're in Namibia! 

Swakopmund sits on the coastal edge of the vast Namib desert - the locals affectionately called the German town. With German architecture, language, food, and beer, it seems like a literally deserted town. The sand dunes sit at the end of every street and creep up the town covering streets often - you'll see a few people sweeping the sand in the mornings. On the other side of town sits the Atlantic ocean. The sand dunes climb right up against the ocean until they meet at a point called Sandwich Harbour. Swakopmund is a 130 year-old town founded by the Germans. In the 1900s, it was the main harbour of the territory. Now, it's a hub for tourists to explore the surrounding areas. In fact, we were lucky enough to be here for the town's birthday festivities including a street market, performance, and speeches from local politicians. 

The name of the town is German for Mouth of the Swakop river. Even though it's named after the river, being in a desert, it's mostly a dry river bed. With rainfall of 0-8mm per year, the river relies on rainfall in the East for it to flow. The last time it was a river was 12 years ago where it flowed all the way into the Atlantic Ocean.

With South Africa as their neighbour and former colonizers, there are definitely similarities. Grocery stores have biltong bars (dried meat that melts in your mouth), braai stations (sauces and rubs for your barbecue), and more than 50 types of rusks (a heartier - arguably more boring - version of a biscotti). But in true German fashion, they also have way too many options for muesli and kraut.

The beaches are filled with birds like white pelicans, flamingos, and cormorants. Pelicans never fail to amaze me in size. Every part of them is always bigger than I'd expect: mouth, wings, eyes, head, etc.

Near the sand, we spotted a few dolphins and even had a Cape Fur seal play with us while we're kayaking. Bobbing up and down and spinning around until it got too close that it scared everyone: me, Nick and the seal. 

In a community called Spitzkoppe, not too far from the coast, mountain peaks rise steeply from their starkly flat surroundings. These mountains are made out of granite. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, which can only be made underground. These mountains tell us that once the Earth was as tall as these peaks. 

Granite also holds two different temperatures on the outside vs the inside. During the day, the outside temperature is cool, making it preferable to hot sand for insects and animals. In the night, it gets hotter on the outside and cooler on the inside. These temperature changes means the rock is constantly contracting and expanding making it have hollow spots within the mountain. Tossing a rock in these mountains creates both dense and hollow sounds as it bounces down.

These mountains act as shelter and a home for many with lots of different nooks and crannies that open into wide spaces. Trees coming out of rocks. Tight corridors that you think will be claustrophobic turn out to be spacious. 

They also acted as a canvas for the San people (aka San Bushman). As semi-nomadic people, they followed the water, animals, and plants as the seasons changed. They'd communicate with each other through paintings that described the environment around them. Using a mixture of rock and animal blood, they'd paint animals like giraffes, kudu and the people of their group to tell other San families about the environment. These paintings are still there 2,000 years later. They'd finish their paintings with a type of varnish made from a mixture of ostrich eggs and a few other powders.

Ostrich eggs weren't only good for painting but were also helpful during droughts. They'd poke a hole in an ostrich egg shell, fill it with water, put a stick in the hole, and bury it in the ground. An ostrich egg can hold 1L of water, equivalent to 22 chicken eggs.

I've often been amazed at how much life is in the desert. We often think of it as arid, empty, and repetitive.

In the Namib desert, most mornings are greeted with a heavy, wet fog that contains droplets of moisture. With very little ground water, these water droplets are welcomed. These tiny droplets hydrate plants and even some insects. An endemic plant to the Namib called the Nara famously absorbs moisture through its stems - rather than its roots like most plants. While the Darkling beetle uses the bumps in its shell to condense and direct the water to flow into its mouth. The fog hydrates insects and plants. The bigger creatures like Springbok and lizards get water from the moisture-rich leaves of plants and juicy insects.

In the afternoons, the desert can be so hazy that the surrounding landscapes, whether it's the Spitzkoppe mountains or the dunes, just fade into the horizon. The haze can be caused by dust or from the salt of the ocean creating clouds.

In the heat of the desert, plants and trees create shade and food for many creatures. The plant's ability to adapt to its climate is astounding. Plants pop up after years of lying dormant just waiting for a bit of moisture. And river beds are covered with large trees and bushes. The closer you look, the more you realize the desert isn't empty at all.

The desert is hardly repetitive. As mountains erode and turn to gravel and then sand, these tiny particles get picked up by the wind and carried all over the desert. The wind carves the granite mountains into awe-inspiring sculptures that last until they fall into rocks to gravel to sand. These areas change from mountainous regions to badlands to gravel deserts to sand dunes. The wind creates ever-surprising shifts in the dunes - building on top of dunes, shifting their peaks, and creating avalanches. The wind also carries rock from different areas forming shadows with dark dolerite and red granite swirls along the ridge of the dunes. The further inland the sand sits the redder it becomes as it's been oxidized for longer. 

In the Namib desert, there is a particular region called Sossusvlei. "Sossus" is Nama for dead end and “vlei” is marsh in Afrikaans, translating to "dead-end marsh". With a white, flat, cracked ground, they starkly contrast the red tall dunes. These dunes are no regular dunes - but star dunes. Star dunes are formed by winds that change direction making them sculpted on all sides. Rather than having a singular sharp ridge, they have three or more ridges coming together in a star shape.

Between the dunes of Sossusvlei sits Deadvlei. An eerie skeleton forest. Between the white, salty, cracked floor, jet black leafless camel-thorn trees stand tall. These camel-thorn trees grew when there was a regular supply of fresh water. But as the climate changed and the sand dunes crept nearer cutting off the path of the river, the trees died. Their skeletal remains remind us that this was a green corner of the Namib. Some of these trees are estimated to have been dead for as long as 700 years. But without any moisture, they're so dry that they simply don't decompose.

Beetles race along the desert with fused wings to prevent the excessive loss of energy required to fly. Like most insects in the desert, moving fast along the the hot sand helps save their tiny feet from burning.

The Sheppard tree folds its leaves in the heat to conserve moisture. The larger their leaves, the more energy is used and water evaporates.

Welwitschia trees derived from the Jurassic period existed before the continental drift. They live for 2,000 years or more. With trunks that go into the ground and only sit a few hundred centimeters high are mostly made up of leathery leaves - specifically two leathery leaves.

The most surprising plant we've found in the desert are melons. Such a thirst-quenching fruit found in such a dry place.

Lichen covers the rocks of the Namib desert. Originally from the ocean floor with the water evaporated, they lie in the heat. As water droplets collect on its leaves, it opens in such a dramatic way that it's visible to the human eye.

Succulents like the dollar bush store so much water in their leaves that you can squeeze water out of it. Imagine what that'd be like for a thirsty animal.

Social weavers live and collaborate with birds of other species. They create massive nests with anywhere from 20 to hundreds of birds live. They make the edges of the nest by the tree trunk spikey to ward off unwanted snakes. Their homes are under constant construction - always improving and making them bigger.

Groups of oryx run along the ridges of the sandy dunes. Straight horns almost as long as their legs stick out of their head. These horns are used when playing and fighting with each other and protecting their young. Similar to us, they sweat to cool their bodies in the heat of the desert. But once it passes certain temperatures, it stops using sweat to conserve the moisture and switches to breathing through their nose to cool the blood going to their brain.

Springboks get their name from their springy legs. They bolt quickly and easily when they feel threatened. They don't only run fast - but they jump quite high every few steps. This helps them appear larger to their predators. The most unusual of this behaviour is what's called "pronking". They bounce along the ground with their legs extended and what looks like a limp neck. The best way I can describe it is it looks as if they're playing dead in the air and then bouncing off the ground. Springbok look very similar to impala but their face markings make them great candidates to join the heavy rock band KISS. Their colouring is very intentional: the reddish brown colour on their bodies match the red dunes, while the white reflects the heat, and the dark brown absorbs it making them able to adjust their temperature quite easily.

Meerkats live in groups on the ground. There's always a lookout surveying the area. Standing tall with its arms dangling by its body, it's head turns to the left and the right. The dark patches around their eyes look as if they've been crying after wearing mascara but actually serve as a way to reduce the glare of the sun during lookouts.
