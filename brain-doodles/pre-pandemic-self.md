title: a letter to my pre-pandemic self

Good morning my love,

You have no idea what is about to come. No one does. And even when it's here, you won't really know how to describe it. The words we have today won't capture the emotions felt, pain suffered, and lives lost. 

All this pain, heartache, and injustice will lead to a more true and beautiful life for yourself. You'll grow in ways you'll never have imagined - in ways that I still find unbelievable. 

You'll experience so much hurt that you won't know can bear it. The muscles around your heart will feel so tight that if you inhale, the muscles will snap like an elastic stretched too far. And with all that you live through, you'll feel like one of the lucky ones.

Life will move so fast. Like a hummingbird's wings, life will become a blur. You won't be able see it or process it. But you'll know it's moving because it's flying. The days will keep on moving forward. And like a hummingbird, you'll only know how quickly she's moving when she stops. For only one second, you'll see her - before she makes her next move. 

For two weeks, the office will close. They'll introduce a quarantine. You didn't want to be stuck in your shoebox in the sky downtown for two weeks. Staying with Mum and Dad will help make up for those times you didn't visit. It's been a long time since you lived with them. 

The last time you did, you left 10 months early to move out on your own. You wanted to move out so badly that you hovered the pen over the signature of a lease that required you to take out the landlord's and the other tenant's garbage. This time you'll have the compulsion to do the same. 

As two weeks becomes indefinitely, the tension in the house will build. The house will feel like an ice castle. The sharp cold wind will whistle through the empty halls, as your parents share icy looks, as they pretend the other one doesn't exist. 

Work will become emptier too. New customers will plummet. Bank accounts will drop. You'll be told that you need to let go of more than half of your team. You'll go from a team of a six to two - you and Roman. You'll cry in each call. It will be so hard. They were doing great. We were doing great. 

_It should've been you. Peter can learn anything. Leo is more intentional than I could ever be._ You'll try to outrun the pain. No amount of time on the treadmill can make you feel the pain they must've felt. You'll learn that your pain doesn't take away theirs. 

Everything about your job changes. You won't even be able to remember the days where you would skip from your desk to meetings - not because you were late, but because you excited. Each day will feel like swimming up from the bottom of the ocean with an 1,000 pound weight tied to your feet. Some days, you might be able to catch a breathe above the water. But it'll quickly pull you back down.

By the sixth week of this, the hummingbird will fly in. She'll sit there with her blurred wings and make her next move.

After never driving more than 100km in your 24 years of living, you'll drive from Toronto to New York. You'll move in with a boy. A boy you've known for almost ten years. The one that makes your laugh heard by the neighbours, the one that stretches your smile so wide you think it might fall off your face, the one that has made you feel as precious as a princess and as neglected as the dust on the floor.

For two months, you'll spend day and night in a residence in the Four Seasons. The sky-high white walls will glow with warm sunlight as it spreads to the each corner of the room every morning, and the city lights and the Empire State building are the entertainment every night. 

To you, it's absolutely gorgeous. For him, he finds the imperfections like a hawk hunting it's prey. He finds the spec of paint on the window sill, the molecule of stone missing from the countertop, the tiniest dent in the hardwood flooring. His dreams for his new home that he had bought the month before and moved into the day before you arrived evaporate. The residence becomes a display protected by glass. _No touching._

Footsteps are too loud - HIIT workouts are out of the question. Cooking will dirty a kitchen this clean. Washing clothes in the laundry machines deprecates their value as fast as driving a new car off the lot. 

You'll whisper on your calls from the bathroom floor, while he talks so loudly in the main rooom that it comes through all your calls. He'll never offer to trade, even just for one call, even when you ask. 

He won't let you go outside alone. He doesn't trust you to be safe. His thoughts soon become yours.

The bathtub will be the only space for you to exist as you are. And still, you'll muffle your cries in the bathtub. 

Everyday you'll try to make your existence less and less noticeable to him. You'll try to take up less space. He'll be the giant growing, and as he grows, you shrink. You'll become so small that you're just human cutout. You'll realize you can't tip-toe your way out of existence and you'll always exist too much for him.

You'll realize that you've been protecting him. You took his behaviour as your flaws. You didn't want people you loved, the people who respected you to know the secrets behind these doors. 

You abandoned yourself rather than the apartment or the relationship. You stayed for everyone but you. And I know you feel embrasses and ashamed as you read that. And I get that, because I did the same thing.  But that'll  change because you make it change. 

But you are full person. And you deserve to live in places where you can be your whole goddamn self. So you'll leave. 

The hummingbird flies.

In your shoebox in the sky in Toronto, you'll realize how much of yourself was muted. The rainbow canvas had turned grey in New York. Even in a two week quarantine where you couldn't leave your 500 sq ft apartment, you'll freer than you have since you decided to go to stay with your parents. You'll find yourself in the moments when you dance in the kitchen, cook a delicious meal, listen to R&B while watching the sun set over Queen St West.

During those two weeks, you'll decide to apply grad school in the UK even though it's only a week away from the deadline and you'll give your landlord's notice. You're ready to move on from Toronto. Born and raised in the city - it's time to go somewhere new. But where?

You end up being accepted into the grad school you applied for. You'll decide to defer. You're not sure what to study, you're not super excited about the school, and it's COVID. And you're not going to settle again.

Instead, you'll ask your only nomadic friend to go travelling with you across the country. In one of the 28 different places you've called home, you'll fall in love.

On the road, your parents will tell they're separating. Although it's not shocking, it still hurts. It means there is a unknown path forward. The pain that I was so comfortable with will be replaced with new pain.

It will feel chaotic and still, slow and fast. It's the toy car that races down the hardwood floor so fast that it's a blur. The movement is so fast - your eyes don't capture it, your brain doesn't see it. You try to determine what happened. Eventually, you piece it's path together with what you can see - where the car started and where it is now.

Then, you'll have the moments. The moments where you grab the toy car, pull it backwards, and see every single sping of the wheel. You catch breathe and are in awe of the movement and speed at which it just moved - the movement and speed that you just created. And you let it go and it be so impressed how far it went.

In this time, you'll have driven to a new country to find love and leave heartbroken, let go and rebuild your team, learned and navigated your parent's separation, applied for and been accepted to five grad schools, travelled across country and called 28 different places home, the most loving, supportive partner, and ran 3 half-marathons. You'll have reached new levels of exhaustion.

It will feel chaotic and still, slow and fast. It's the hummingbird that's wings are moving so fast that it's a blur. Your eyes don't capture it, your brain doesn't see it. But 

-------

Some days it'll feel like walking past a cemetry. Everyone will tell you to hold your breath. And you will. But the cemetry is never-ending. It's never time to breathe.

---

It will feel like a pruning. They'll cut the old, and damaged leaves. Except, the gardener did a bad job. Entire branches fundamental to it will be cut and destroyed. They'll grow again but it won't be the same.

You'll cut entire branches out of your life that are fundamental to who you are. This pruning leaves you 

You'll have to wait for them to grow back. And when they do, they look different than they did before. Broken. Lifeless.
