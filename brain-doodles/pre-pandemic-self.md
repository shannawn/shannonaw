title: a letter to my pre-pandemic self

Good morning my love,

You have no idea what is about to come. No one does. And even when it's here, you won't really know how to describe it. The words we have today won't capture the emotions felt, pain suffered, and lives lost. 

All this pain, heartache, and injustice will lead to a more true and beautiful life for yourself. You'll grow in ways you'll never have imagined - in ways that I still find unbelievable. 

You'll experience so much hurt that you won't know can bear it. The muscles around your heart will feel so tight that if you inhale, the muscles will snap like an elastic stretched too far. And with all that you live through, you'll feel like one of the lucky ones.

Life will move so fast. Like a hummingbird's wings, life will become a blur. You won't be able see it or process it. But you'll know it's moving from the soft hum of the hummingbird's wings, and logic. The hummingbird is flying in mid-air. The days will drum forward. And like a hummingbird, you'll only know how quickly it's moving when she pauses before she makes her next move. It's only for one second and in that second, you'll see her.

For two weeks, the office will close. They'll introduce a quarantine. You didn't want to be stuck in your shoebox in the sky downtown for two weeks. Staying with Mum and Dad will help make up for those times you didn't visit. It's been a long time since you lived with them. 

The last time you did, you left 10 months early to move out on your own. You wanted to move out so badly that you hovered the pen over the signature of a lease that required you to take out the landlord's and the other tenant's garbage. This time you'll have the compulsion to do the same. 

As two weeks becomes indefinitely, the tension in the house will build. The house will feel like an ice castle. The sharp cold wind will whistle through the empty halls, as your parents share icy looks, as they pretend the other one doesn't exist. 

Work will become emptier too. New customers will plummet. Bank accounts will drop. You'll be told that you need to let go of more than half of your team. You'll go from a team of a six to two - you and Roman. You'll cry in each call. It will be so hard. They were doing great. We were doing great. 

_It should've been you. Peter can learn anything. Leo is more intentional than I could ever be._ You try to make yourself feel the pain they must've felt. No amount of time on the treadmill can make you feel the pain they must've felt. Not even when the belt is whipping so fast around the machine that it sways from side to side with each stride. No matter how fast or far you go - you can't fast enough or far enough. Eventually, you'll learn that your pain doesn't take away theirs.

Everything about your job changes. You won't even be able to remember the days where you would skip from your desk to meetings - not because you were late, but because you excited. Each day will feel like swimming up from the bottom of the ocean with an 1,000 pound weight tied to your feet. Some days, you might be able to catch a breathe above the water. But it'll quickly pull you back down. It'll be like this for six weeks.

_Wings drumming. She pauses before her next move._ 

After never driving more than 100km in your 24 years of living, you'll drive from Toronto to New York. You'll move in with a boy. A boy you've known for almost ten years. The one that makes your laugh heard by the neighbours, the one that stretches your smile so wide you think it might fall off your face, the one that has made you feel as precious as a princess and as neglected as the dust on the floor.

For two months, you'll spend day and night in a residence in the Four Seasons. The sky-high white walls will glow with warm sunlight as it spreads to the each corner of the room every morning, and the city lights and the Empire State building are the entertainment every night. 

To you, it's absolutely gorgeous. For him, he finds the imperfections like a hawk hunting it's prey. He finds the spec of paint on the window sill, the molecule of stone missing from the countertop, the tiniest dent in the hardwood flooring. His dreams for his new home that he had bought the month before and moved into the day before you arrived evaporate. The residence becomes a display protected by glass. _No touching._

Footsteps are too loud - HIIT workouts are out of the question. Cooking will dirty a kitchen this clean. Washing clothes in the laundry machines deprecates their value as fast as driving a new car off the lot. 

You'll whisper on your calls from the bathroom floor, while he talks so loudly in the main rooom that it comes through all your calls. He'll never offer to trade, even just for one call, even when you ask. 

He won't let you go outside alone. He doesn't trust you to be safe. His thoughts soon become yours.

The bathtub will be the only space for you to exist as you are. And still, you'll muffle your cries in the bathtub. 

When you're with him, you hate yourself when you're with him. The worst parts of you emerge from shadows and into the spotlight. They thrive. The self hatred becomes rampant. You'll want to disappear. You'll try to make your existence less and less noticeable to please him. You'll try to take up less space. He'll be the giant growing, and as he grows, you shrink. You make yourself so small that you stop getting your period. You'll tiptoe yourself out of existence. But even then, there's still tiny footprints. You'll always exist too much for him.

You'll realize that you've been protecting him. You took his behaviour as your flaws. You didn't want people you loved, the people who respected you to know the secrets behind these doors. 

You abandoned yourself rather than the apartment or the relationship. You stayed for everyone but you. And I know you feel embrasses and ashamed as you read that. And I get that, because I did the same thing.  But that'll  change because you make it change. 

But you are full person. And you deserve to live in places where you can be your whole goddamn self. So you'll leave. 

_Wings drumming. She pauses before her next move._ 

In your shoebox in the sky in Toronto, you'll realize how much of yourself was muted. Blue skies looked grey in New York. Two weeks in your 500 sq ft apartment in downtown Toronto feel like the most magestic sunset. Even in quarantine, even in a pandemic. You'll find yourself by dancing in the kitchen, creating a delicious meal, listening to R&B while watching the night sky over Queen St West.

It's like someone has been playing tug of war with your life. And it's comfort versus growth. Comfort has been winning. Growth is starting to get her footing. She's digging her heels into the ground and pulling harder. Her hands are blisters from the twisting of the rope. She's going to win.

 From the release of tension | the momentum, you fall forward. The future is now yours. What do you want? That's a big question. It's hard to answer, so focus on what you don't. You don't want to live in Toronto anymore. Born and raised here is enough. You don't want to focus on breadth of impact but depth - helping people in ways that fundamentally change lives. Rather than helping families find care for their kids, you want to make people have the control to choose if and when they want them. And if the pandemic will teach you anything, it's that health is so pivotal. It almost sounds banal because it is. But this experience will make you feel it and bask in its righteousness. You'll change your course from social anthropology to medical anthropology. In the spare moments of your days for the net five months, you'll be crafting a personal statement and researching your next step. You'll apply to the top UK grad schools and get into them all. 

During those two weeks, you'll decide to apply grad school in the UK even though it's only a week away from the deadline and you'll give your landlord's notice. You're ready to move on from Toronto. Born and raised in the city - it's time to go somewhere new. But where?

You end up being accepted into the grad school you applied for. You'll decide to defer. You're not sure what to study, you're not super excited about the school, and it's COVID. And you're not going to settle again.

Instead, you'll ask your only nomadic friend to go travelling with you across the country. In one of the 28 different places you've called home, you'll fall in love.

On the road, your parents will tell they're separating. Although it's not shocking, it still hurts. It means there is a unknown path forward. The pain that I was so comfortable with will be replaced with new pain.
