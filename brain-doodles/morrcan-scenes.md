After a month in Morocco, we've explored the imperial cities, Tanger, the desert and so much more. Here are some of the scenes from our trip:

Extremely intricate and deatiled almost wooden scales that vary in depth on ceilings. In Tanger, they even had a mirror on the table, so that you could more easily admire the work. 

Calls to prayer ringing through every town and city - even in the desert.

Young Moroccan men asking where you're from and offering directions as a way to give you a tour. This later got more advanced with telling us roads are closed, so they'd need to offer directions.

Communal ovens situated in the medina. Boys carrying trays of dough to be cooked in the oven. Men in the oven tossing hot bread. Motor bikes filled with big totes on either side like a donkey, wheelbarrows (equivalent), and donkeys waiting outside the oven to load up their bags with fresh bread and bring to shopkeepers.

It's lunch when you start to see smoke coming from souks and resturaunts. Tagines lined up outside the resturant with meat hanging from the shop. In a town close to the desert, we ordered lamb. They cut off a piece right infront of us. For the ground meat, they grinded right there adding herbs for flavour.

Chickens in the medina. Souk owners weighing live chickens as customers come up asking for chicken. They'll kill the chicken right in front you, so you know it's super fresh. Our cooking teacher wanted to show us this. She waited for the truck and eventually, went somewhere else. Later, the chicken man called her letting her know the truck had arrived and made us listen to the chickens clucking in the back. 

Gardens in cities like Rabat and Marrakech act as oases from the wildness of the medina and the city.

Children playing sharing mini cars eating candy like coloured popcorn or cotton candy in central plazas. While other kids play soccer in the square. 

Walking through the narrow, winding, high walled streets of the medina. Twisting and curling with souks lining the sides. Everything from shoes (the latest styles of Nike, etc) to spice mounds, several types of dates and nuts in potato sacks (in Marrakech, fancy colourful bins with patterns on them), piles and piles of green, black and red olives and different other mixes, fresh bread being made, metal being sculpted with their hands, and live animals. As you walk by, everyone is inviting you into the shop asking you to come in and take a look. Kids find nooks where kids play soccer or bounce the ball of the wall or walk with a box on their head.

Finding serenity in malls. No matter where you are the shopping mall seems to play the same type of soft pop music with glaring lights and tiles. 

Colouring materials with natural elements. The alley of re-dying clothes in the Fes medina using henna (orange), saffron (yellow), blue (indigo) and mixing those colours to get what you need. Take an old dress or pants there and you'll get a brand new look. The Fes tannery for leather where people walk around vats of dye and pigeon poop to clean the camel, cow, and sheep leather and stitch them into bags. The smell is so strong that they give you fresh mint to smell during your visit. To Beber painting in the AÃ¯t Benhaddou casbah where they use tea, rose, saffron, and henna to create water colour paintings with flame.

Enjoying sunny breakfasts on the terrace with a new type of bread every day in Fes. Sfinj (donuts) to Msemen crepes to Beghrir pancakes, harcha (semolina), bread (khobz) and I'm probably forgetting some. Avocado in fruit salad.

Plaster carvings that surround doorways and arches that line the perimeter of rooms. Starting with a design and tapping it with charcoal so that the design is imprinted on the plaster and beginning to carve a design in Fes.

Seeing more donkeys than bicycles. Especially in Fes.

Walking the old streets of Volubilis and seeing the mosiacs from 3rd century BC. 2,000 years later. 

The Swiss town of Ifrane nestled in the countryside of Morocco with peaked houses, and parks lined with trees.

Couples and families sitting on the sand dunes close to town having a picnic.

The flat roofed, natural coloured homes with smoke in the air from local shops, children playing socccer outside, men sitting in their souks with the gates open looking out into the street sipping tea as they chat with a friend. Every town, no matter how small, with a mosque.

The gates of the desert. A swarm of children biking as school is out and they head back home riding up to 10km each way. Schools painted in rainbow pastels in each town.

Driving past trucks with a V-shape of the loads they carry. Others carrying sheeps on top as they slide around on every turn.

On the side of the roads, men shepherding their sheep and goats. Men having up to 1,000s of sheeps and goats and knowing them all. 

Sand as far as you can see. The curves of the sand looking so surreal almost like clouds but you can walk on them. Sand moving like water. Throwing sand in the air and the wind catching it before gravity does. 

Never knowingn what they holds or what's happening next on tours forcing you to stay present. 

Agricultural oases with irrigation systems where families have plots and take turns moving the first to create a funnel for the water to their crops. Growing almonds, dates, onions, carrots, etc. Palm tree forests in the desert. Another desert oasis: Gorges.

A surprising amount of trees, flowers, and vegetation in the desert. The orange sand, green plants and purple flowers. Finding chamomile. Smelling lemon leaves.

Visiting a Berber home enjoying Friday couscous with them. As they dressed us up in clothes for a Berber wedding. They women took me to another room giggling and excited as they tried to get my arms through the dress. (It got stuck many times).

Getting on camels with no explanation. Riding and rocking on the camels through the sand desert to the edge of the gravel desert. Seeing our glampground light up under the cold, night sky. Berber boys warming up their drums over the fire as they played, danced and sang for us. 

Getting apples, oranges, and a knife at the end fo a meal for "fruit salad"

Women coops. Rose water and argan oils. Argan coops set up with stations and a window seat in shops for cracking the shells wih rocks, and grinding them by hand into oil using stone. Tasting the oils and the almou with bread. 

The night market in Marrakech with monkeys on leashes, snake charmers, souks with dreamy lights, olives covering every wall of a stand, men scooping snails out of a massive pot with hundreds, meat heads around the charcoal grills. Circles in the square with music playing of all kinds from Berber to Arabic. People playing games like catch the soda and gambling with a sheet of cardboard with circles and they bet where the coin will land. Eating catcus fruits out of a stand. The man cuts them and opens them as you grab a toothpick and stick them in your mouth. Seedy fruit where you swallow the seeds and pay the man at the end. Eat as many fruits as you like. 

Shops where you see the whole spice (like ginger root) and they'll grind your spices on the spot. Cinnamon as bark and cumin as green. Both tasting and smelling so strong. Take your olives to get pressed for fresh olive oil. Different grades of nuts. Kill the meat in front of you. The freshest of food. 

Salt, pepper, turmeric, ginger as the base spice of all dishes. Preserved lemons in water. 

Men collecting broken items (and day old bread) and fixing them to resell. 

The crunch crisp of briuats as the cooking class teacher said you can't eat them in secret. 

Surrounded by ornate, colourful buildings that incorporates Andalusian, Arabic architecture with gorgeous courtyards. Never knowing what the inside will look like from the outside. 

People feeding monkeys. Let the monkeys come to you. Don't grab them. Monkeys walking all over people and through the caves where the limestones was formed around ancient trees. 

Boats in Ouzoud falls with people bringing their own drums and music and dancing on the boats as they move in and out of the waterfalls. 

Families bringing pots and tagines and teapots with gas tanks to the park where they sit under olive trees and enjoy the day.

The sweetest of deserts and tea. Four huge sugar cubes per teapot. Sugar cookies glazed in sugar. 

Sitting in a eucalyptus steam room as a women dumps a bucket of water on you. Rubs black soap that feels like butter over your skin. Wait in steam room with the hot marble. Lie on your face to scrub all the dead skin. Giggling as they clean. Showering in the steam room as the two women go in and out of your swimsuit. Giggling with a final slap of the bikini bottom. I guess I was taking too long.

Two motorbikes driving side by side and talking as they ride. Motorbikes talking to pedestrian and picking up or dropping off a friend at intersections.

Patios line the streets with men sitting in chairs facing the streets sipping tea. 

Sometimes, our host wore a hijab, but not every day. While women may be modest in the streets, they are more comfortable in their nudity than North American women are at the hammam.
