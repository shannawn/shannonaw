We've been in South Africa for about 6 weeks. After our next month in Namibia, we will have spent 1/4 of the year in Africa. When this year of travel started, my goal was to learn more about the continent. I'm feeling like that was achieved in many ways. But like so many things, it's only once you learn a little do you realize how much more there is to learn, experience, and explore.

Our first experience of Africa was Morocco. It was our first time in a Muslim country. In an Arabic country. And we felt it. It challenged our assumptions about Africa. The image that we're taught in school about Africa is grasslands, partially naked people running around, singing and dancing to drumming with political upheaval. We have yet to see _that_ image of Africa. 

Our time in Morocco brought forth the understanding that Africa is a very heterogenous continent with many different cultures, countries, peoples, religions, etc. We knew we wanted to learn more.

Africans talk about the country being separated in three regions: Northern Africa, Sub-Sahara Africa, and Southern Africa. Northern Africa is predominantly Muslim and Arabic countries. Northern Africa encompasses Egypt, Morocco, Alergia, etc. Sub-Saharan African encompasses most of the countries in the continent whcih canbe further broken down into Western, Eastern and Middle Africa. Southern Africa includes Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and a few others. 

Unlike Morocco where the country is 99.9% Muslim. Many jews fled from religious persecution in Andaulsia. However, as the Kingdom of Nekor dominated and spread Islam throughout Berber and other communities, many Jews were killed and/or converted.

In South Africa, most of people are either descendants from Europeans (like the Dutch or English), indigenous tribes of Africa (like Xosa and Zulu), or brought in from other parts of Africa (like Madagascar), Southeast Asia (like Malyasia and Indonesia), and India. The Europeans brought in populations around the globe to be their slaves. They wanted more "skilled" slaves, so they focused on bringing in people from their other colonies. This brings lots of diversity to South Africa. There is a large population of Muslims (from India and Indonesia) and Christianity and some Hinduism - especially in Cape Town. Most of the nation is Christian - specifically identifying with the African-initiated churches. These churches helped incoroprate Christian teachings with their cultural beliefs such as polygamy, cosmology and others. 

South African cuisine is characterized by delicious Durban curries (where are large population of Indians live), sweet and tangy Cape Malay curries, samosas, and sambals, Afrikaanz braai, and Zulu and Xosa pap, biltong, and 7 colour plates. Durban curries are traditionally served stuffed in a loaf of bread called "bunny chow". When people would bring lunch to the feilds, there would be no way to carry the curry - so they put it in a loaf of bread. It is delicious and literally an entire loaf of bread carved out and filled with curry. Cape Malay is one of my favourite cuisines. They use lots of spices but manage to keep the flavour while adding a little heat. Locally, Indian food is known as being extremely spicy, while Cape Malay is much more mild. Cape Malay food uses local ingredients like coconut, apricot jam, cardamom, cinnamon, bananas when recreating Malay dishes. They have similar types of food to Indian cuisine like rotis and samosas - but with very distinct flavours. One of the most famous desserts are koeksisters and milkterts. Locals believe that Cape Malay versions of these foods are flavourful while the Afrikaanz versions are quite bland. Most grocery stores and bakeries sell the Afrikaanz bland koeksisters and milkterts. Afrikaanz cuisine is mainly the foods that the Cape Malay would make for them as slaves. A braai is a barbeque with lots of meats and even breads called roosterkoek. With pap and veggie stews, these foods can be found all over Africa. Pap can be made from any grain and is turned into an almost-porridge where you grab a little pap with your hands shape it and pick up the stews and veggies around your plate. The seven colours plate is a traditional South African meal that would include rice or pap, meat, and sides such as pumpkin, sweet potatoes, beetroot, cabbage, beans salad, potato salad, or coleslaw. Classically, pap is made with mealie which is white corn but can be made with anything like millet to sorghum. Biltong is a dry cured meats - anything from beef to ostrich to springboek. It almost tastes like spiced beef carpaccio. 

A drink that doesn't quite fit into any category is roobios tea - it directly translates to "red bush". It is so popular here that most coffee shops serve "red lattes" and "red capuccinos". Roobios tea leaves are made in a similar shape to espresso, so that they can be used in an espresso machine. These are one of my favourite drinks in the morning or in the afternoon. It is said to help digestion.

There is a very big culture of herbs and plants to aid illnesses. You can find plant supplements in pharmacies with instructions for how they help your body. In both the Cape Malay and African cuisine cooking classes, they both boasted about the rich healthy of their foods. They discussed the benefits of adding spices like turmeric and large quantities of vegetables. It is something that seems to be front and center in people's minds. 

Beyond individual health, they're very aware of climate change. Signs are on cigarette ashtrays in the streets showing how long it takes a cigarette to decompose. By the boardwalk, they have photos of the sea animals and birds with the impact of climate change. In Seapoint specifically, there are lots of shops emphasizing local foods. We noticed this in Morocco too. Everyone knew about climate change and used strong language to talk to us about its impact on their crops and livelihood. Developed nations have built structures where their wealth protects them from the impact of climate change while creating the vast majority of the consequences that other people around the world experience.
