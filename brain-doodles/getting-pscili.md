I'm really glad I did the solo pscilybin trip. It wasn't as magical in the way I thought it'd be. I wasn't taking in by nature and awestruck by its beauty. 

I was much more in my head. I was thinking about lots of ideas, my sense of self, and my journey ahead. But that was still valuable.

Looking around at all the Dutch infrastructure can be inspiring. They seem to have perfected cities and civilization. Clear bike routes. Lots of signage and indicators. Many social norms and behaviours. In some ways, this is freeing. It frees my mind to focus on other things. In other ways, it's restrictive. It was so hard for me to find a piece of uncultivated nature - not farm fields, not a single bike route in a field, but a park where I could eat a sandwich. When I walk, people look at me. As if, they're wondering why I'm not biking. When I wave or smile at them as I pass, they seem confused. It's almost like they're hollow, monotonous beings.

In Southern Africa, there were so little norms. It meant that anyone could do anything at any time. This meant sometimes I don't know what to expect which can be scary. But everyone greeted me with big energy and tackled life fully. I don't think I could go to Africa and use the word "hollow" to describe any piece of it.

It's easy to get overcome with indecision when I'm in the extremes of having a very specific goal or no goal at all. 

If I have a specific goal, each decision I make either takes I closer to that goal or away from it. 

If I have no goal at all, every decision changes the next decisions I'll have available - making each one super important.

On the bike ride, when I had no direction, any decision became the one that made the direction which meant it had to be the "right" one. And when I decided I wanted to go home to Nick, each decision either brought me closer or further to him. 

When I have no goal at all, but a specific vision, that's where things become challenging. I had the vision for a nature path on a magical bike ride. Everytime I found myself near civilization, I was disappointed. If I had come up with a plan to meet the goal, it would've been clear when I was making progress. 

Sometimes, we have no goals. Then, we're not worried about _shoulds_ but we can focus on embracing the experience for what it is, rather than what it's not.

Other times, we have say we have no goals, but we actually have little movies in our heads how we expect things to go. If I have the little movie, then it's goal, and I should be intentional about achieving it.

Whether we're out in the world or in a world of our own thoughts, there is so much stimuli. It can be overwhelming trying to take in all the sounds, sights in my focus and peripheral views, smells, and sensations in the outer world. It can also be exhausting trying to follow all the thoughts and ideas popping into my head.

But if I just focus on a single aspect, it'll create a grounding feeling. When I was biking along a path beside the highway. I tried to focus on the flowers by the bike path, the people biking by, the traffic on the highway, and all the sounds that come with these inputs. But once I just focused on the flowers along the bike path, I didn't just find calmness but joy and beauty.

This is true with my thoughts too. It can be challening to focus on one thought and quiet the noise of my internal dialogue. It's hard not to create spirals of thought patterns but move a single thoughts forward. That's why breathe and music are so powerful. It takes me into the moment. It removes the focus from the constellation of my thoughts and places it onto one.

That's also why I find talking or writing super helpful. It forces me to focus on one thought and continue with it.

If we try to focus on everything, we end up focusing on nothing.

It can be hard to make decisions. Deciding which thought to focus on, picking the right path, etc. 

It's scary to make a decision. It might take me wandering off course, I might get lost, I might end up somewhere I didn't want to go.

But making a decision is better than indecision. Because deciding not to make a decision is a decision too.

Indecision brings a state of paralysis and the illusion of stagnanation. I might think that by not making a decision, nothing will change and I can make a choice later. But regardless of whether I make a decision or choose to not to make a decision, the things around me will keep moving forward. 

I can only prevent things from moving forward with what's in my circle of control. Beyond it, not making a decision is still a decision as it will change the decisions available to me in the future.
