We've arrived in Africa - specifically, Morocco. I'm so excited to be in a new part of the world where we can learn about other cultures, religions, plants, fauna, and more. 

Yesterday, we walked along the beach and ate at this cafe on the pier. We were introduced to a new type of bread, cheeses, spreads, and orange salad. 

As we were walking towards the medina, we heard the prayer call. Men were shouting at us trying to get us to go on a tour or talk to us about where we are from, etc. We visited a museum where we saw the oldest weapon in the world: a sharp rock. The cielings were beautifully carved with multiple layers and dimensions that were best seen by looking at the mirror placed on the table. There were beautiful gardens where we ran into a turtle snacking on a fruit. We explored new flowers. The prayer call continued. Because it was a Friday afternoon, the prayer call went on for the entire afternoon. There was a melodic rhythym we fell into. 

We walked outside the museum and a man was waiting for us - offering a tour. We started walking with him through the medina. The houses stacked beside and on top of each other. Cats running down the alleys. Most families have cats in and outside the home - up to eight or so. There's no running water in the medina, so there's a communal fountain. Likewise, with an oven to bake the bread and other foods. These public areas, along with hammams, are where families and communities spend time together. Even in other parts of the city, public areas like parks are filled. With small homes, the amount of time spent in public areas is very different than in North America.

There isn't a separation of church and state here as there is so much of the Western world. Islam is taught in schools. Prayer calls heard all over the city - no matter where you are. Many men and women are dressed in religious wear. Lots of women in hiqab, much less in niqabs and burqas. Most men wearing djellabas. Both genders wear loose fitting clothes that cover most of their skin and their heads.

It shows me how much of Islam I don't know. There are beliefs that I really agree with like Zakah which means donating to those in need - at least a portion of your wealth after basic needs are met. As Allah created us all equal, we should live that way. Also acts as a way for people to "cleanse themselves of their wealth" and greed. Practicing prayer five times a day based on the sun along with all other Muslims in the world. They believe in practicing self-restraint against temptations like alcohol and of course, Ramadan. Focused on following Prophet Muhammad's message that he recieved fromm Allah, they aim to make the trek to Makkah as well. 

They believe in Jihad (struggles). Greater Jihad is the internal struggle of purifying yourself while the Lesser Jihad is the open struggle against God's enemies to defend Islam.

Being blonde with only tight fitting long sleeves, our skin colour, and Nick's height makes us stick out like sore thumbs. It makes me feel vulnerable. Men are everywhere. I feel like I saw very few women when walking in the medina. 

This is the first time feeling culture shock since we've begun our nomadic life. It's the small details where the differences are felt. Tissue paper has a unique musky smell. The buildings look polished from a far and the details show their age and deterioriation. There isn't any alcohol served in public and none to be found in grocery stores. Art on the walls are filled with women and men wearing clothes I haven't seen very often. Homes have different rooms and styles where I even wonder if the baselines of living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroomm are still fitting. Tea is not served with dessert - but before or after.

These are noticeable differences from Spain and Portugal and the Azores. Interestingly, the all share similar climates and flora. Birds of paradise and palms are the focal points of roundabouts like the Azores. We're noticing tile similar to those in Portugal. Islamic architectural details like Spain - yet the buildings beyond the medina are also new and rundown compared to historical and restored.

Spain introduced me to Islam in the gradual and comfortable way where women that dressed like me were still the majority. But here that changed and that change is felt. I feel claustrophic like there are only so many ways for me to express myself. That doesn't involve wearing the clothes I usually wear. That doesn't involve adventures by myself. That feels different: uncomfortable, unsettled, and sometimes, unnsafe. 

There isn't an even balance of uncomfortable and awe and wonder as I usually associate with travelling. This uncomfortable and unsettled feeling is the feeling of a lack of perceived safety. It's scary and I'm scared. Last night, it was hard for me to go to sleep even when in our Airbnb because I kept feeling like someone might come in and do something. Leaving me claustrophic, anxious, and fearful. Fear relies on judgements and ideas that aren't willing to be questioned or changed. It's the process shutting down and turning inwards. It's the opposite of open-hearted, curiousity, exploration and education learned through travelling and in the identity of a traveller.

It's hard for us to untangle the different aspects that make us feel scared. We grew up in a era and a country that villanized Islam and Muslim people. We were taught to associate hiqabs and other religious wear as danger. Taught that Arabic is a language spoken by enemies of equality, rights and freedom. That Muslim women need saving. 

Northern Africa is challenging our assumptions about Africa, Islam and Muslim people. The Africa that we're shown as kids is in the Savannah. There's colourful dress. Some people wearing lots of clothing. Others wearing very little. Animals like cheetahs and lions roadming free. The Islam we were shown as kids were evil as were Muslim people. Northern Africa is much more Middle Eastern that either of us expected. It is possibly the most different part of the world from what we knew: the language, culture, religion, socio-economic statuses, rights, etc. In November, it became illegal of unmarried couples to share a room with up to a year of jail time. 

The first step to checking our subconcious, judgements, and interalized islamophiba and xenophobia is through education. We've started to read more and learn more. 

Day two, we're becoming aware of the cause of feelings and working to change them as we head to the capital of Morocco, Rabat. I'm confident that each day we spend in Northern Africa will teach us more about ourselves.
