Maslow invented the hierarchy of needs. 

We have fundamental needs like:

- physiological needs: food, water, shelter, air, sleep

- safety & security: health, employment, housing stability...


These fundamental needs must be met before we can achieve higher order needs like:

- love & belonging: belonging, intimacy

- self-esteem: confidence, achievement, respect of others...

- self-actualization: morality, acceptance, purpose, etc.


Relationships also have a set of needs. 

This pyramid will look different for different types of relationships.(parents, siblings, friendships, romantic relationships).


Romantic relationships might have fundamental needs like:

- respect: acknowledging that they are an individual with their own thoughts, ideas, and goals

- understanding & communication: listening and appreciating each other's perspectives, define the nature of your relationship


And we can have higher order needs like:

- trust & intimacy: being vulnerable and rely on each other

- shared values: building a shared way to guide your decisions and priorities

- growth: supporting each other's goals and exploring how you can improve the relationship


Each of these needs will look different based on your own values and priorities. 


Looking to build a family?

You might prioritize commitment & care over growth where you want to ensure stability to enable your family to grow.


Looking to build an empire with your partner?

You might ensure that your shared values involve career goals and financial stability.


Making your own pyramid with those you care about can help ensure that your needs are being met.
