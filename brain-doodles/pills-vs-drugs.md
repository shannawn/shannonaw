title: pills vs. drugs

I take pills. I take Advil, Motrin, Reactin, Benadryl, NightQuil, and many others. I’ve taken Birth Control pills every day for 6 years or more of my life. And I’ve also taken recreational drugs.

Interesting, how we call “pills” one thing and “drugs” another. 

“Pill” sounds so small, so inconsequential. “Drug” sounds like a big decision with a big risk. 

Our society has created substantial narratives around the differences between these two. These narratives tend to be more morally than medically or scientifically driven.

We view pills as targeted medicine with small side effects on your body. We take a pill for a headache, believing it has no impact on other systems in our body. Unlike pills, we view drugs as changing our entire experience - from how we experience the world, to how our body functions. There’s uncertainty with not knowing how it will impact you, your behaviour, or your mind in the short or long term.

We view pills as made in labs with rigorous trials that are then judged objectively on their scientific methods and results before reaching the public. While drugs are made in homes by average people.

But let’s say that pills and drugs are more similar than we think. 

*Pills almost sound so small, so inconsequential.*

Is a pill less inconsequential than a drug? No, this is just linguistics and marketing. It sounds small because the sounds are lighter, smaller, and tighter. And that was intentional. The name of these drugs was chosen by governments to create these associations. Because of this, I’ll use the word “drugs” in referring to both pills and drugs.

*Pills are targeted medicine with side effects on your body.* 
Pills and drugs are both drugs that we put into our bodies. 

When we put these drugs into our body, they change the signals that tell our body important signals like our level of nutrients, fatigue, stress, etc. And our bodies are adaptable ecosystems that are trying to maintain a level of balance. Like many other ecosystems, when one aspect changes, other things change to adapt. Because of this, it’s very, very hard - arguably impossible - to have anything in our body that only targets one area. So, if we put something in our bodies, it will most likely impact other systems, organs, and cells. And not impact only the intended area. 

Because these drugs impact the signals that our body receives, these drugs impact our entire body and our behaviour. Any drug impacts our entire experience. Our bodies do not purely provide biological function and/or dysfunction, but our bodies impact how we feel, how we behave, what motivates us, and thus, the world around and within us too.
Because of this, with each drug we take, we need to figure out if it works for our bodies for our experiences. It’s not a question of if it has impacts on our body, behaviour, and mind, but if we like those impacts.

*Pills are made in labs with rigorous trials that are then judged objectively on their scientific methods and results before reaching the public.*

In our North American culture, we believe that humans observe and discover science - not that humans produce our knowledge of science - thus making the study and methods built upon human bias.

If we know that science is not objective, but subjective. Then we need to build systems to prevent those biases from shaping how these trials are executed and evaluated.

Today, our society biases towards clear, easy-to-understand results. This means that scientists will choose methods and create trials that make the results simple, often leaving out a level of nuance to accurately capture the results. These scientists are also competing with the limited resources of time, money, and resources. And to make sure that these drugs get to the public as soon as possible, their results often don’t capture long-term consequences and often exclude women due to the complexity of our hormone cycles.

Right now, scientists are doing the best they can to understand the effects of these drugs with the information they have. And that’s okay - that’s all we can do - but as the consumer, we need to understand that these drugs aren’t foolproof.

*All pills are drugs.*

I believe that all pills should be thought of as drugs - and we should call them that. We should view any new drug we can take as having the potential to change our entire experience of the world and how we move within it. And that change will be different for every person. 

We should understand that drugs are made with the best information that the scientists had at the time - not all the information ever. And that drug trials are not comprehensive - so we should be more critical of the results and claims by the drugs.

We should remember that no one how drugs impact our bodies better than us because no one knows our bodies better than us.
