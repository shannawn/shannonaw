What is sex? This question has plagued me on and off for decades. 

The hardest no one ever told you was that you'd need to discover what it means for you.

Sure, there are universal qualities of sex in how our bodies react. But most of what sex means is defined by how we others feel during sex or about it. It's about women as objects of sex. It's about achieving male orgasm. It's about heteronormative assumptions.

What if those assumptions were removed? What would sex be and how would it become?

Glennon Doyle describes sex as a place. Sex is a place where my mind and body exist together. 

It's where my mind is filled with desire, tension, and excitement. The tension builds, my jaw tightens, my toes curl until I feel like I could burst. 

It's where my body is completely surrendered. My arms extended, my legs parted, my body surrendered to whatever comes next. 

Then, all of sudden my body experiences relief in waves until the tides calm and I'm laying on the beach basking in the sun.
