We got some shit birth control options:


Option 1: Take a drug every day at the same time.

These drugs alter your hormones, which can impact your feelings, thoughts, and actions.

Who doesn't want to tie their emotions to different times in the day?

8:55 feel good. 9:00 great. 11:35 fuck.


At a stage where you can barely make sure your own needs are met?

Add a logistically stressful responsibility to your life.

What could go wrong?


Oh and this option provides no protection against STI/STDs


Option 2: Insert a foreign object in your uterus. And leave it there.

Don’t worry about changing your lifestyle like you would with a drug.

Just simply put a tiny little object inside your body and get on with your life.


Some of them have hormones, which can impact your feelings, thoughts, and actions.


Some don't. Instead, you get some combination of:

1) Heavier and crampier periods

2) No periods

3) No change

And there's no way to tell which.

It's like a grab bag for your body.


Oh and no protection against STI/STDs.


Option 3: Wearing a glove. Every time.

No hormones, no lifestyle change, no foreign object in your uterus. 

Just remember to wear one, every single time.


Adds a nice break with sex. Folks can grab a sip of water and get ready for the next phase. 

All the best decisions are usually made “in-the-moment”. 


And protects against STI/STDs.


Option 4: Inserting a dish in your body. Every time.

No hormones, no lifestyle change. Yes, foreign objects but only temporarily. And you need to remember to insert it, every single time.


If you don’t want to take a break during sex, just plan in advance and insert it up to 2 hours before. 


Bonuses:

- Can’t be used during your period

- Can also increase UTIs

- Needs a chemical that may increase the risk of HIV and infections.


Oh and no protection against STI/STDs.


Option 5: Check your fertility vitals every day

No hormones, no foreign objects. Just change your lifestyle. 


All the benefits of taking a drug every day. But now, take your temperature, check your body for changes, and track it all. 

It only works on non-fertile days. 

So find another option during fertile days.


Oh and no protection against STI/STDs.


Option 6: Get a quick surgery.

No hormones, no lifestyle changes, no foreign objects. 

Just cut off the routes for sperms and eggs to meet with a “simple” surgery.


Recovery time varies dramatically. Reversibility varies on the method and may impact longer term decisions. 


Oh and no protection against STI/STDs.


Most of these rely on those with eggs to protect themselves from pregnancy. 

There’s been buzz in the past about more options for those with sperm to help share the burden. 

But they never make it past the trials. 

Apparently, there are *too* many side-effects. 


I’d really appreciate it if the medical industry gave everyone some better birth control options.


In the meantime, any decision you make to protect yourself and others is the right one.
