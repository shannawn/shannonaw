Even the name of ‘family planning’ itself can uncover the assumptions within their programs. ‘Family’ planning includes an assumption of a family as inevitable, as opposed to a name that includes the decision if a woman wants children. A generous interpretation might look to understand the idea of ‘family’ as inclusive of forms beyond genetic kinship. 
Perhaps, ‘family’ is meant to signal the parties involved in the planning process, rather than the object of such planning. In this collective unit of family, women and men that create these genetic families are viewed as equal participants and sites for intervention. Yet, these programs focus almost exclusively on women with the partner being so often ignored (Nandagiri 2021). If the partner is included, they are seen as ‘partners’ - as only relational to the woman, and future mother - with no specific targets to increase their individual contraceptive use (Nandagiri 2021).
Turning to ‘planning’ implies the intentional and rational thought in determining one’s future actions. It denotes ideas of ‘management’ in which the individual is responsible for properly executing. Often labelling those who do not effectively manage their fertility as ‘irresponsible or even failed citizens caught in “cultures of poverty” that therefore needed to be altered [with further intervention]’ (Murphy 2012, p.19).
