I was listening to Glennon Doyle's podcast. She talks about wearing a bulletproof jacket that is some sort of emotion, approach, or way of being that makes us feel less vulnerable. Especially, when we're in a fight with someone, we're there because we're feeling soft emotions like hurt, sad, fear, vulnerability - and we want to protect ourselves from these emotions, so we toss on the bulletproof jacket. Brene Brown calls this self-protective behaviour "our armour" and my therapist calls them the "firefighters" that impulsive behaviour you have when I begin to feel my most vulnerable parts.

Our most vulnerable and softest parts of ourselves are the parts that make us human. These are the parts that are intimacy-seeking, sensitive, hopeful, and open. These same parts create the most joy in our lives and wearing the bulletproof jacket, armour, or calling in the firefighters makes it impossible for us to find the joy again. We start fighting the bulletproof, the amour, or the firefighters rather than giving the vulnerable and soft parts the space we need.

My bulletproof jacket, my armour, my firefighter is my anger. Because I need to prove to others (and myself) that I can take up space and that my experiences are real and valid.

So when I wear my anger, I talk loudly - to prove I can take up space and you can hear me. 

Growing up, I didn't want to take up space. I wanted to take up as little space as possible. With a speech immpediment, any word I said created too much attention - even if it was just to say "here" during the attendance. It signaled to people that I was different. And I felt like my thoughts didn't deserve that attention. Sometimes, it made me feel completely invisible and made me question if I was really there at all.

When I wear my anger, I list all the ways that I'm right - to prove that my experiences are real and valid.

Whenever I did speak when I was a kid, I worried that people would think I wasn't smart. And with two professors as parents, being smart was an expectation. And at home that was reinforced by making a business presentation to justify your wants and needs.

Those feelings combined with early manipulative relationships where my thoughts and experiences were constantly invalidated made me question if my thoughts and experiences were even real. 

I actively continue to work towards taking up space and trusting myself in knowing my experiences are real and valid. As the progress I make on myself will always come up in my relationship with others - and often, those I love most. And when I do feel triggered, I need to make sure that I'm creating enough space between the stimulus and my response to act in the ways I want to.
