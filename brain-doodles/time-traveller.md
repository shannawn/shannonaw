I feel like I'm living in the future. Not focusing on the present moment, or even the next thing. But a few things down the road. 

I'm jumping from a month ahead to 6 months ahead to a year ahead. I'm missing the ability to relish these moments.

I can feel myself become led by the striving, ambitious, perfectionist where nothing is good enough.

It's taking me out of appreciating this moment and making decisions that bring me closer to my dream self.

I feel like Nanny Lane isn't set up enough for success. I'm worried if I'll be able to find something that I'm as good or as comfortable with as this role. But Nanny Lane will be set up for success by the time I leave. It's the best I could've done with way more notice than an average transition would involve. No matter what position I leave Nanny Lane in - it is a good position and it will be successful because I believe in the team and the future leadership. I have lots of skills & abilities. I can always find a role similar to my current one in the future. But my goal is not comfort or success - it's learning. Focusing on the role I want after Oxford or fearing the temporary nature of CareGuide isn't serving me. Because even the role I have at CareGuide is changing. I don't know what the options are after Oxford - the goal right now isn't to choose a career but to learn about a space I care about. That might look like talking to people in the space, reading more, attending talks, meeting folks in my program - but it's okay if it doesn't. 

The truth is I don't know what I'll want to do after Oxford. And that's okay. It might not be that I want to work for Doctors Without Borders. If I do, it's probably after a bit more time in the space, or if I choose to do it after school - I'll take a French course then. Right now, I'm looking for courses that are a week long - that week could be done anywhere. It's probably better close to.

I'm stressed about making the most out of my sabbatical. I'm focused on it as a once in a lifetime opportunity - which is true. But I can create a sabbatical at any point. It isn't about having the best sabbatical - but resting and rejunevating before school. I deserve rest. I need rest. I live a life of adventure.
