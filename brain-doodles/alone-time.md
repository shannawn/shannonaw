So today is the first week of living alone with Nick since May. I realize how important it is to have our own space. 

Especially, when my family is a transition phase. Everyone needs validation about our family and the individual relationships.

And they need it constantly.

But when I'm living with them, it literally feels constant.

It feels like everyone always needs something from me. And I can't seem to find my voice or the strength to say "wait - i need something from me first."

At work, as a manager, everyone is asking something of me. At home, everyone is asking something of me. 

The only person who isn't asking something of me is me. And that's the person who needs something the most.

I find myself feeling more and more like a vessel, a hollow shell of someone who once lived here, in my body. But now, just exists in service of others.

And I don't want that. I don't want any of that. 

I've lost the habits that I created to make space for myself. And without any space for me to exist, I disappear. 

I used to find myself when running. Time just for me. And running long distances made sure I had at least an hour or two dedicated to myself, my thoughts, my wanderings. 
But I got athlete's foot and bad blisters and stopped for them to heal.

I took up biking. I cycled several times a week, hitting 100km most weeks. I listened to a feel good playlist with '00s and '80s hits.
Then my bike broke. 

I'm now able to run short distances on my feet - which means I also do more intensive workouts and I fixed my bike.

I signed up for a writer's circle that starts this week. That means I'll have a few hours a week of lessons, writing, and exploring with myself and others. 

I booked an appointment with a natropath that ensures I'm putting myself and my body first.

I'm ready for a new season. A new season that makes space for myself. A new season that celebrates me.

**Where do I start? Build some new habits.**

First, everyday is a new day. 

Second, I'll delete spaces where I don't want to spend time. Goodbye, instagram. Goodbye, slack. 

Third, I'll double down where I do want to spend my energy and time: writing, running, learning about myself (body and mind).

Fourth, ruthlessly say no.
