It's been a while. It feels like I haven't been alone with my thought long enough to write them down. That's probably recency bias - but still valid.

We just got to Cape Town last night. We're in store for what they call a "Cape Storm" - what that entails I'm not sure. But they say we have a great view to watch. Nestled between the ocean and the mountains, we're sitting on Signal Hill. The amorphous clouds cover the sky telling us that a cape storm is definitely on its way.

Grateful to be dry, I just grabbed my roobios tea. The quiet stillness on this rainy afternoon seems unfamiliar, foreign yet comforting. Like a hug welcoming you back. Reminding you how good it feels to be slow. 

It's easy to go fast. Especially, being a nomad. There's always something to explore, eat, try. There's always a plan on the horizon. Logistics to be handled.

This lifestyle doesn't cater well to reflection. Or not the way we've practiced it.

I'm looking forward to the year at Oxford as there will be a stillness associated with it that I haven't had for the last two years. 

As the fantasy of "Oxford" becomes closer to a reality, I find myself thinking, fantasizing, and worrying. Is there really a difference between a fantasy and a worry other than the feelings associated it? Both an imagined reality - just one positive filled with possibility and the other negative filled with doubt. I've been trying to focus on fantasizing. What might a morning in Oxford look like? What will I be reading? What kind of discussions will we have in class? What will running be like? Where will we be able to bike? What activities at my college will I join? What will happen after Oxford? Where will we live? What jobs could I have?

<!-- I can easily drift to worry about finances. I don't want to be rich. I just want to have enough money not to worry about money. Isn't that being rich though? Richer than most of the world. I'd have to live pretty dramatically. Today, I could probably live for at least 3 years with my savings without touching my RRSP or going into debt.  -->

Sometimes, they become more worries. And when they are, I try to remember these as passing thoughts. 

I can feel myself being pulled forward to thinking about post-Oxford. Nick and I are looking at Youth Mobility visas and thinking about Hong Kong or Japan or New Zealand or...? I'm thinking about health tech jobs in the reproductive space, IDEO or idea coutoure firms, or non-profits potentially. 

When I feel that pull, I'm trying to open a book or read something going on in the space today. 

In a prvilieged world where you can do many things, the challenges always lies within the choice. 

As of today, my parents are divorced. The papers filed and will be automatically declared once reviewed. It's been a hard almost two years with this over our heads. It's really sad that they weren't able to put the energy needed into the relationship to make it work. They had so many years to change it. I'm definitely relieved. There is also an unexpected realization that this is the new normal for my family. I know that is not completely true. They are divorced but the current state of our family will ebb and flow for many years to come as Lindsey and I change as will our parents and their relationships.
