"Oh, please don't. Please don't try to help me."

When I read this line in Liz Gilbert's Big Magic, I could hear the exhaustion and disinterest. She was talking about her reaction when people tell her that they want to write a book in order to help other people.

More and more in society, we are told to live lives for other people.

Almost as though, if we don't do it for other people, it's not worth doing. But what about just doing something for ourselves?

Who cares if other people get value out of it or not? What if all that matters is how we feel about it?

Because isn't trying to help other people just another cage we put ourselves in? Isn't it just carving a life that depends on how others receive your actions, rather than forging a life of my own?

**What would it mean to create a life where we live for ourselves?**

Glennon Doyle describes creating a life for ourselves as creating a world that is true and beautiful enough for us.

I think it's as easy as just starting with asking myself "is this true and beautiful enough for me?" in moments of my life. 

And this might be helpful in identifying the moments in my life that are "there she goes" vs. "there she is"

"There she goes" moments happen when the light inside me fades or dims - everything gets a little darker, and sometimes the light just goes out.

"There she is" moments happen when I feel like the truest and most beautiful version of myself. 

**There she is**

For me, "there she is" moments are when I'm listening to music, taking a bath,  reading a book, sipping a mug something hot, dancing in the kitchen, cooking a meal for myself, listening to an album while lying on the floor, conquering the unimaginable in a run, a swim, or a cycle, making the space to explore a thought and write it down... 

As an anxious person, my brain can be loud - too many thoughts, opinions, to-do lists, and "there she is" hushes all of it - a silence falls over my body and my mind.

They happen when I listen to music and I hear every beat, every word. I'm taking a bath my thoughts center on the amazing sensation of the water on my skin and through my hair. I'm reading a book that hushes my own thoughts as I enter someone else's. I'm sipping a mug of something hot slows the world with each sip. I'm dancing in the kitchen and cooking for myself enables me to feel the music as I want as I create a dish just for me...

These are the moments I want more of. These are the moments where I am at the center of my life - where I'm forging my own path to create the truest and beautiful life for me.

**What's happening in other moments of my life?**

So if "there she is" moments happen when I feel like my trustest and most beautiful self, what's happening in other moments of my life?

Where is the self? Where is the truest and most beautiful self?

I think the self is invisible in the other moments. 

It's kinda like walking into a room and seeing a floating kettle pouring tea into a cup, a pan frying an egg, and dishes setting the table. 

It sounds magical. But now imagine, there are actually people moving these objects - someone is pouring the tea, frying the egg, and setting the table. The people moving these objects wouldn't feel very appreciated. They might even forget they exist, forget to take up space, forget to be grateful for themselves.

This is sometimes how I feel in my life. I focus on what's going on outside of me, rather than my role in making it happen. 

I'd be grateful for getting into Oxford - while not recognizing my dedication in writing my personal statements, my determination in getting the required documents, and my bravery to try something new.

I'd be grateful for swimming across the lake - while not recognizing my courage to try to swim across the lake, my curiosity to explore my strength and my strength and determination for ensuring I succeed. 

I want to reintroduce the self into my life. I want my own appreciation and recognition for who I am.

Because I'm not only grateful for the life I have today but who and how it was created. And who continues to imagine a true and beautiful life for me and creates it. 

And because I don't recognize my role in creating the moments I'm grateful for - the moments that lead to "there she is". I also don't recognize my role in creating "there she goes" moments.

**There she goes**

"There she goes" moments happen when I prioritize others' (real or perceived) expectations over myself. This could just opening Slack to see if anyone needs anything even if it's after hours. This could be trying to please my parents by compromising my alone time to equal amounts of time with them both. These are moments where I don't recognize my role in creating these scenarios and therefore, forget that I have the power to change them. 

Even if I fundamentally know that everything is changing all the time, sometimes I don't feel that way. I don't feel like this can change. And I forget that anything can change if you put in the effort (or at least most things). But changing things can sounds exhausting and scary. 

And it is exhausting. Change is exhausting - but so is keeping things the same. In these moments, I need to tell myself that "I might feel tired right now, but dealing with the situation will make me energized in the future."

And it's scary. Change means the unknown. Change means new. In these moments, I need to tell myself that "I'm confident in my abilities to tackle any challenges that may appear."

"There she goes" moments are also the moments when I place too high expectations on myself. These expectations come from the idea that today will be the same as tomorrow. As I said earlier, I know this isn't true. But I feel like this is true. And when every day is the new tomorrow, it means each day has very high stakes. 

Vacation is the antithesis of this. Vacation is the exception, not the rule. It is a disruptor. No routine. No external pressure. It is liberation. Today, you might read. Tomorrow, you might write. Wednesday, you might do nothing. Every single day is a new day. 

Now, imagine if the vacation was every day. Imagine that every day was just a day. Imagine that I trusted myself to know that if I didn't do something today, I could do it another day.

I want this for myself and I'm working on creating it. I can ask myself "do I want to do that?" before taking an action. I can set boundaries with others. I can acknowledge the expiration dates on a challenge I'm experiencing by telling myself "This a ______ minute/hour/day issue." 

**Where's the trust?**

Glennon Doyle talks about control as what happens when there is an absence of trust. I try to control parts of our lives and others. I do this because I worry that if I don't control it, it might not happen. I do this by explicitly trying to control my behaviour. _Write a  gratitude list every night._ _Don't eat that._

I also do this with where I focus my thoughts. _If you don't do it now, you'll never do it._ _Recent graduates have a hard time finding jobs after they graduate._ My thoughts are telling me biased information to control my behaviour.

I try to control my behaviour because I don't trust myself. If I trusted myself, I wouldn't need to control it. 

And this lack of trust necessitates control and with control comes structure and routines and pressure. (The opposite of the liberation that I experience on vacation.)

I would trust myself to be able to find gratitude moments without needing a list, to eat what I needed, to do things on my own timeline, to put in the effort to find a job when the time comes. 

I would trust that I know what's best for me at any given moment. I would have compassion for myself. If I'm not doing something now, that's okay. We have a lot going on now. And we'll do it later. Trust that I will do it. If it's important, then I won't forget. And if I do forget, it wasn't important.

And by trusting myself, I'll be able to love myself. Because trust is a requirement for love. 

**How do I learn to trust myself?**

Let's start with the opposite of control. Let's start by putting biased information towards trust in my thoughts and behaviours. These are thoughts that focus on my abilities - not my fears, and not my inabilities.

They are thoughts like: 
* "I'm confident in my abilities to tackle any challenges that may appear."
* "I have tackled harder things before."
* "I'm choosing love today."

Through building that trust in myself. I'll be able to listen to my body when it tells me it needs rest, food, or exercise. I'll be able to listen to my heart when it needs connection. I'll be able to listen to my mind when it tells me it needs stimulus. 

And I'll be able to trust myself to set boundaries and to follow my dreams.
