We're taught to focus on how our body looks.

I'm been trying to change this:


What if I focused on what my body does and how it feels instead?


No more negative thoughts about my body like "I hate my thighs because they're too big"

Even rather than positive thoughts like "I love my thighs because they're beautiful - cellulite and all"

I'm trying: 

"My thighs enable me to walk and help me run"


Moving away from the images of what my body should look like.

The ones created in media that get grilled into my brain. 

The one that focuses on women shrinking their bodies. 

But still curvy in all the "right" places.


The media produced image of my body requires hyper control.

Absolute control over what I eat, how I exercise, and how I live. 

And controlling things that I actually can't. 

Like genetics.

Using endless time and energy micro-optimizing each decision. 


Even when I try to focus on how my body moves with exercise classes.

The titles and instructors talk about how I look, not how I feel. 

Classes are literally called "Build-a-booty" and "Widdle in the middle"


I try to focus on what my body feels like and what it allows me to do.

This can sound like:

"I'm grateful to my belly for holding my organs"

"My arms feel strong today"


In all situations, our bodies come in so many forms that aren't captured in media. 

They're captured in the strangers on the sidewalk. 


I try to remember all the extraordinary things my body is doing everyday:

- pumping oxygen through our lungs
- moving blood through our body
- breaking down and absorbing nutrients
- fighting against bacteria
- processing as much as 74 GB of information
