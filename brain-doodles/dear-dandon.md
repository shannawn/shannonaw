Dear Dandon,

I am who I am because of you. And I'm so proud to be who I am. 

Ever since I was little, you always treated me like an adult - asking us questions about our thoughts, ideas, and beliefs. You never treated us like we were small. You met us our level - whatever it was. And when you did, you had a sparkle in your eye and a little dance and song. 

I can see you walking into the front door singing New York is here to say hello to you with your arms wide and twinkling your fingers. I know you always called me dramatic - but you were quite the dramatic yourself. 

I can hear you're "Wow" - something I'm known for now at work, something I adopted from you without even realizing. 

There are countless things that I do because of you - conciously and subconciously. 

It's impossible to list out all your Grandon-isms because frankly, you're an original through and through. But I'd like to try to write a few:

You were a unique mix of daredevil and cautious. You'd do something risky - but you'd only do it once. Your Christmas gifts were not beautiful, but always incredibly practical. They'd be wrapped in duct tape with full caps sharpie writing. It'd most likely be a new windshield wiper, or something that everyone knew they needed but no one would've bought themselves. You always made sure that everyone was safe. You thought of everything - every scenario and prepared us for it. Even this one. Your "big trip".

And even though, you were 99. And I should've seen it coming. I didn't. As Linds said: "I was prepared in your 80s. But once you hit your 90s, I thought you'd live forever."

And I'm so grateful that I got 26 years with you. That's so many more than most grandparents and grandchildren have. 

The hardest thing for me about this is that I wish you could see all the ways you influenced me. Even though, we had so many years, the heartbreaking part about grandparents and grandchildren is that they're passing trains. As we're finally able to engage and understand your wisdom, you're already losing it. 

This makes the fact you treated me as an adult from the day I was born even more special. You always wanted to know what I thought about things - what my "big" ideas were.

I remember the countless tours of St.Lawrence and SUNY asking "what are you thinking about these days". I think we did a solo tour everytime I visited. We'd walk the campuses and you'd tell me the stories of your students and stories about you and Grandmom. You always called me "analytical". Little did you know how that'd shape my identity. I don't know if I would've viewed myself as smart without you. 

And now, I'm starting at Oxford next fall. You and Grandmom always set high standards but low expectations. I knew whatever I'd do you'd be proud. From no one in your family having anything beyond a grade 6 education to you completing your PhD in Sociology, I'm so grateful to be able to attend such a prestigious school. I know you were super proud. You wouldn't take the St.Atony's scarf and Oxford hat I got you for your 99th birthday off. And to be studying Medical Anthropology - your hobby combined with your profession. Especially after the "big whiz" career in tech. 

I'm so grateful to have had such a cheerful, light-hearted, caring, prideful, and brave grandfather. A grandfather who's heart was "SO BIG" that I'm not sure I could name something you didn't love with all you were. 

I love you so much. And I know you knew that. But there will always so much love that was never expressed and I hope you still felt it. 

Thank you for holding on as long you did. 

Always,
"Big" Shannie
