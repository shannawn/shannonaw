I didn't picture it like this. _This_ wasn't the moment I wanted. 

I wanted a different one. 

I wanted the moment that filled with excitement. The one where I can't wait to share the good news, where I can barely breathe without sneaking in a giggle or a smile, where I fall into the arms of my life partner to celebrate the moment we've been waiting for.

Because it's _good_ news. 

But I got a different one. 

***

It had been eight weeks. Eight weeks of waking up and feeling exhausted before I even opened my eyes. Trying to get out of bed felt like an impossible feat. I could feel every single muscle and let me tell you, every single one of them was sore. I would muster up all the strength I had and put on my comfiest clothes. The ones I picked always looked enough professional enough to work at a tech start-up. And they have a pretty low bar. A hoodie and soft pants became my new uniform. I went from someone who showered every day to someone who only showered if they had the energy. And most days, I didn't.

I opened the fridge to see if I could eat. It smelled horrible. I immediately shut the door and left. 

I walked 15 minutes to work in the busy downtown streets of Toronto. Streetcars were flying down the street. Beautiful people dressed to the nine's heading to the financial center. There was a hum of the city. And more importantly, for me, a smell. I walked slowly and tried my best not to sweat. Unfortunately, any movement I made created one. 

I would try my best to focus at work. I had just transitioned to a new product that focused on making child care more accessible. And I had just been promoted to the product manager. Everyone else on the team had been working together on the product since it's inception and I was the stranger. The exhausted stranger. 

Every conversation, interaction, comment took energy out of an already empty pot. 

I'd leave work an hour or so early and walk home. I'd open the door, eat a slice of toast, and sleep. 

I'd sleep bewteen 12 and 14 hours each night and then it'd start over. 

I used to be someone who could work out every day. Hit the treadmill. Do some strength training. But that felt like a different person.

I didn't feel I knew my body any more. Every moment felt like an insult and a reminder that I'm not who I once was. I felt like an alien in body. Someone else had taken it over. 

And I didn't know just how right I was.

Growing up, I felt like the female body was a mystery. My mum had gotten me books about puberty. The books where you could see an drawing of a body and then as you flip each page, you saw the body go through puberty. We talked about it together. We talked about with my sister. And my sister and I talked about it. 

The books said all this stuff that didn't make any sense to me. I'd much rather my body had stayed the same. I always hated change and the fact that these books were telling me my body would change and I would have no control over it was terrifyiing.

And I remember thinking it was full of shit. All the books said that I would "get hips." And that's how I know the books didn't make any sense. See, I already _had_ hips. And if they didn't know that, then they might know a lot of other things. Like the other things they claimed they did know.

Later, I'd have puberty classes that touched on the female body. They had separated the boys and girls for today's class and they rolled in the old projector from the closet down the hall. As the teacher rolled it in to the class, I felt my whole body get hot. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. But, I had already started feeling the shame and embarassment for whatever they were about to tell me about my body. She stuck a diagram of the female reproductive organs in the projector and rolled it back until it filled the entire front wall of the classroom. 

She started talking about fallopian tubes, uteruses, and periods. She showed us a pad and a tampon and told us about how we'd bleed once a month, every month for a long time. BLEED. She warned us about toxic shock syndome. And never seemed to circle back to the fact that this thing that I had only seen my body do when I was hurt was going to happen once a month, every month for the rest of my life (or so it felt). Did that mean I was going to have pain every month? Why did girls need to suffer through this every month and not boys?

I studied and memorized what I needed to, so that I could ace the test but ended up forgetting most of it. Well, I forgot all the science stuff. Everything else was hard to forget because that's all we talked about on the playground and then between classes as we got older. We gossiped about who had their period, who was wearing bras, and who had kissed boys. And I wanted that. 

My sister and I had convinced our mumm to buy us bras. I had a tiny training bra when I was 10. It had a cartoon tooth fairy on it. I was as flat as board. But that didn't matter. What I wanted was the right of passage. And that came with wearing a bra.
