I didn't picture it like this. _This_ wasn't the moment I wanted. 

I wanted a different one. 

I wanted the moment that was filled with excitement. The one where I can't wait to share the good news. The one where I can barely breathe without sneaking in a giggle or a smile. The one where I fall into the arms of my life partner to celebrate the moment we've been waiting for.

Because it's _good_ news. 

***

It had been eight weeks. Eight weeks of waking up and feeling exhausted before I even opened my eyes. Getting out of bed felt was an impossible feat. I felt every single muscle and let me tell you, every single one of them was sore. I mustered up all the strength I had to put on my comfiest clothes. The clothes I picked looked professional enough to work at a tech start-up. But they have a pretty low bar. A hoodie and soft pants became my new uniform. I went from someone who showered every day to someone who only showered if they had the energy. And most days, I didn't.

I opened the fridge to see if I could eat. It smelled horrible. I immediately shut the door and left. 

I walked 15 minutes to work in the busy downtown streets of Toronto. Streetcars flying down the street. Beautiful people dressed to the nine's headed to the financial center. There was a hum of the city. And more importantly, for me, a smell. 

I walked slowly and tried my best not to sweat. But, any movement I made created one. 

I tried my best to focus at work. I just transitioned to a new product that focused on making child care more accessible. And was promoted to the product manager. Everyone else on the team had been working together on the product since it's inception and I was the stranger. The exhausted stranger. 

Every conversation, interaction, comment took energy out of an already empty pot. 

I left work an hour or two early and walk home. I opened the door, ate a slice of toast, and slept. 

I needed 12 to 14 hours each night. And then the day would start over. 

I went from someone who worked out every day. Hit the treadmill. Did some strength training. But that wasn't me anymore. I felt like a different person.

I didn't know my body any more. Every moment felt like an insult and a reminder that I'm not who I once was. I felt like an alien in body. It felt like someone else had taken it over. 

And I didn't know just how right I was.

Growing up, I had always felt like the female body was a mystery. My mum had gotten me books about puberty. The books where you could see an drawing of a body and then as you flip each page, you saw the body go through puberty. We talked about it together. We talked about with my sister. And my sister and I talked about it. 

The books said all this stuff that didn't make any sense to me. I'd much rather my body had stayed the same. I always hated change and the fact that these books were telling me my body would change and I would have no control over it was terrifyiing.

And I remember thinking it was full of shit. All the books said that I would "get hips." And that's how I know the books didn't make any sense. See, I already _had_ hips. And if they didn't know that, then they probably didn't know a lot of other things.

Later, I'd have puberty classes that touched on the female body. They had separated the boys and girls for today's class and they rolled in the old projector from the closet down the hall. As the teacher rolled it in to the class, I felt my whole body get hot. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. But, I had already started feeling the shame and embarassment for whatever they were about to tell me about my body. She stuck a diagram of the female reproductive organs in the projector and rolled it back until it filled the entire front wall of the classroom. 

She started talking about fallopian tubes, uteruses, and periods. She showed us a pad and a tampon and told us about how we'd bleed once a month, every month for a long time. BLOOD. She warned us about toxic shock syndome. And never seemed to circle back to the fact that this thing that I had only seen my body do when I was hurt was going to happen once a month, every month for the rest of my life (or so it felt). Did that mean I was going to have pain every month? Why did girls need to suffer through this every month and not boys?

I studied and memorized what I needed to, so that I could ace the test but ended up forgetting most of it. Well, I forgot all the science stuff. Everything else was hard to forget because that's all we talked about on the playground and between classes. We gossiped about who had their period, who was wearing bras, and who had kissed boys. And I wanted that. 

It wasn't that I wanted to have my period so I'd bleed every month, or wear a bra that'd constrict my breathing, or even liked boys enough to kiss them. But that didn't matter. What I wanted was the right of passage. And that those were symbols of that.

Eventually, I did get my period. 

I was walking home from school with a friend in the eighth grade. From our middle school to my house, the walk was about 45 minutes. So usually, I'd often stop at her house and hang out for a bit before making my way home.

I hadn't been feeling well that day but I stuck through it. I'd had deep stomach pains on and off. The kind of stomach pains that go through to your back. The kind where it feels like a slow drill making it's way through your body. And I used to get a lot of stomach pains in middle school - usually from stress. So I didn't think much of it.

As we were walking, my pants felt a little wet. I figured I really had to pee. When we finally got to her house, she wanted to show me around. Her house was under construction and they'd been making progress. There were tarps and saw dust everywhere. Yells between construction workers and big boots filled the house. We walked around the house and showed me the latest improvements in every room. Then, eventually got to the washroom. There was only one washroom right now. And there wasn't a door. She held up a towel for me. I unbuttoned my jeans, unzipped my fly, and sat down on the toilet. I looked down at my underwear and pants and saw some dried blood. I looked in the toilet and saw the blood.

I knew I got my period, but I didn't know what to do. I was not calm. I wanted my mom. I wanted to go home. I didn't want to tell my friend that I had just got my period. And I didn't know how to stop the blood. 

I remember my mom told me the story of her first period. It was during lunch and she sat down on a bench in white shorts. She stained her shorts and the bench. Her period stained the bench - in front of everyone. 

I immediately thought of how I didn't want to be walking home and for people to see a stain on my jeans. I contorted myself on the toilet to see if blood came through the other side of my jeans yet - nope, I was safe. 

I wadded up a bunch of toilet paper, stuck it in my underwear, and told her I had to go home immediately. I don't remember what lie I came up with to get home, but I was on my way home within 5 minutes of getting to her house.

I wanted to get home as soon as possible, but I still had a 20 minute walk through my neighborhood in front of me. In the neighborhood where a bunch of the kids I went to school with lived. It felt like I was walking past the homes of theives carrying a wad of cash that was poking out of my backpack and at any moment, the cash could fly out of my hands. I was constantly looking behind me to see if anyone was there, and sticking by head between my legs to check for blood stains on my jeans. I wanted to run home. I wasn't sure if that was okay for me to do on my period or if it would get worse. So, I speed walked - figured that it was the perfect combination of speed and calm movements.

Eventually, I made it home. As soon as I did, I went to the basement washroom and sat on the toilet. My dad knocked on the door and asked if I was okay. I didn't know - so that's what I told him. I told him I needed my mom and I wanted on the toilet until my mom came home two hours later. She knocked on the door, came into the washroom, and taught me about pads and tampons. I was had no interest in tampons. Tampons meant toxic shock syndrome. I didn't want to be responsible for getting a syndrome that I was only at risk for because I was a girl. 

I opted for the pads.
