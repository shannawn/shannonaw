This week I've been feeling a little chaotic. I've been focusing on the negatives: my lack of abilities, lack of others, etc. But I've been missing all the good things that have been happening. I've missed that I finished my essay when I wanted to. I went to 3 different rowing evernts this week, 2 extra talks, and hung out with Ayesha, Ally, and Signe and Marlene. Nick and I even went to the botannical gardens and went out for dinner. It was a full week. 

I want to write essays that I'm proud of. I'm going to start prioritizing that in upcoming weeks even if it blurs into the weekend. With Nick's schedule, I think we can be more flexible with when we consider the weekend. If I'm waiting for a paper, we can go for a walk on weekday morning, rather than just doing it on the weekend.
