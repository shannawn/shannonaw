title: 'love story: needs not needy'

In a patriarchal, individualistic world, we create a narrative that casts basic human needs of intimacy, connectedness, and dependency as needy. Especially, for women in a patriarchal society, we are expected to give ourselves fully to their family without having any needs of our own. 

But, in reality, as social creatures, we all have needs and we are all dependent on each other to fulfill them. These needs do not make us needy but make us human. We all have basic human needs of connection, appreciation, understanding, etc. And the more effectively we can depend on one another, the more independent and daring we become. And only when our meets are not being met, do we become more obsessive and demanding to get our needs met. 

Our patriarchal, individualistic tells us that love is where two self-sufficient people share their lives. In a love story with two self-sufficient people, we do not normalize having needs. We try to protect ourselves from being vulnerable. And by doing so, we deprive ourselves of our humanity.

This is a love story is a shallow understanding of what love is and what love can be. 

I don't want this love story. My love story is different.

My love story is choosing to love - letting love win. It's becoming vulnerable in sharing our fears, needs, and desires with each other. It’s trying our best to give and receive love because we want our love to grow. It’s knowing that we need love and deserve love. It’s valuing connection and intimacy over isolation and protection. It’s choosing to show up. It’s trying when it’s scary and hard. It’s sitting together. It’s holding space for each other. It’s being honest with ourselves and being honest with others. It’s letting ourselves imagine, hope, and dream. It’s choosing our humanity - our need for love, our shared understanding, and appreciating our differences. It’s learning together - how to be the best version of ourselves - individually and together. It’s us. It’s knowing that love is freedom. It’s leading with our hearts and letting each other be found despite our fears and our flaws. It’s patience. It’s believing in something greater than yourself - each other.

In practice, it means we're responsible for each other's well-being because we want each other to feel appreciated, loved, protected, admired, and safe. We recognize that we are emotionally dependent on each other. We meet each others’ need for intimacy with more intimacy. We know that sharing each other’s needs and feelings is an investment in us. We confide in each other first and value each other’s opinions most. We make ourselves available when we need each other. We encourage each other in ways that build our confidence in ourselves and make space for each other to come into our power. When faced with conflict, we are courageous in communicating effectively and honestly. And we know that we're always on the same team.
