title: first job, worst manager
date: Aug 19 2021

_I'm falling in love._

My first, real job. Full-time, salaried, benefits. 

The always-slightly-too-loud chatter by the coffee machine. People walking around the office from room to room. The open space concept of pods with fancy monitors and luxurious netted office chairs. The ones every startup has. 

Engineers blasting music through their headphones. Eyes glued to their monitors as their fingers fly. The clacking of the mechnical keywords fill the room.

Designers flocking to the breakout rooms. Always in search for a whiteboard and wall space to explore ideas.

Customer Success with headsets and calm voices as they sip their coffee.

Marketers talking and laughing too loudly as they brainstorm the next big growth strategy to 10x the company. They're the cool kids. 

And _I'm_ on the marketing team. The latest hire. With absolutely no experience in tech, startups or marketing, here I am. Responsible for an _entire_ channel: Email. For twenty-odd sites and upwards of 50 campaigns. 

Within my first week, I got my first project: moving over 50 email campaigns to a new software that no one knew how to use. The manager had a vision for what it would like in the end and I was responsible for making her dreams come true.  

She needed me to code. I've never coded in my life. The only "coding" I knew was pulling quotes from interviews and grouping them into themes. That is coding. 

I'm determined. I learn how to code in three different languages: HTML, CSS, and SQL. Using code of the 90s, I'm making my way through the these endless campaigns.

The project is a nightmare - no clear success markers and for no real measurable impact. 

I have no idea how to succeed. And I'm trying so hard. Starting my days at 6am and coming home at 8pm - barely leaving early enough to eat breakfast and too late to eat dinner. I work on weekends, mornings, and evenings. 

I hated it, and I kept trying. 

_I'm no longer falling in love. I'm still falling - now into a hole._

I was taught that numbers are our lifeline. Every hour I'd check to see if we're meeting our goals. 
_7am: We're behind by 25 subs_. I check all the charts seeing to investigate the root cause. Are new users down? Is traffic down? Is it coming from one channel? Same type of users dropping? 
_8am: We caught up._ 
_9am: We're behind by 50 subs._
_10am: This is supposed to be peak week_
_11am: What's changed?_
_Noon: Things seem to be catching up_
_1pm: Ouch. Down again_
_2pm: Not good_ 
_3pm: Number are down_
_4pm: Who's digging into this_
_5pm: Caught up again_
_6pm: Ouch_
_7pm: Catching up_
_8pm: Down again_
_9pm: Is there a bug?_
_10pm: This is not good_
_11pm: Still down_
_Midnight: Caught up_

Can't stop. Heart pounding, thoughts fleeting, exhausation creeping over body. Could cry at any moment.

Is this normal?

This job was a strip mall Santa. From rosy cheeks, droll little mouth, and a lucious beard to an old man who's a little drunk with a 5 o'clock shadow and masked in the smell of beer.

And I didn't come to the mall for the drunk old man. I came for Santa.

Sitting down with a friend, I tried to find what I actually did like about this job, if anything.

_I hate talking about people as "subs"._
_I hate my boss._
_I hate scare tactics._
_I like data._
_I like working with other teams._
_I like solving customer's problems._
_I like teaching customer's how to use our products._
_I like helping people._

We found my dream job: a product analyst. I want to dig into problems, find where people are struggling using our products, and help teams build solutions to solve them.

My boss will understand. I'll explain to her. 

On Tuesdays, we had our 1-on-1s. We went to Strangelove. I'd get a latte and she'd get a capuccino. 

"I've been thinking a lot about my future and I know we've talked about my career growth at CareGuide."

Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Sweat pooling my palms. Wiping them on pants.

She sips her capuccino. 

"Yeah, great. I can't wait for you to become more of a leader on the marketing team. Are you thinking about another channel? We could really use your help with SMS. It's really similar to email."

_This is not where I want it to go. Reverse, reverse, reverse._

"I was actually thinking about how I'd really like to become more involved with product."

Her gaze sharpens. It's marketing vs. product. I'm crossing enemy lines.

Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Thump, thump. Sweat pooling my palms. Wiping them on pants.

"Marketing is focused on subscriptions and user acquisition. And I'm more interested in product and user experience."

"Marketing is responsible for the growth of CareGuide. Product is a nice-to-have. Marketing is the heartbeat of the company. That's where you want to be."

"I've been thinking about it a lot. And I'd really like to focus more on the user experience of people joining our services and how to keep them engaged. Email is focused more on engagement than acquisition and I think I'd be able to support marketing at the same time."

"But..." She quickly took another sip of her capuccino. 

"I haven't been enjoying work, and I'd really like to find something that would help CareGuide meet their goals and where I could be happier. I'd like to move to product."

She runs out of the coffee shop letting our a few whimpers as she leaves.

I'm sitting alone. Drenched in sweat - my palms, my armpits, my legs. Find a part of my body that is not sweaty.

_Do I follow her? Do I sit here and wait? Do I go back to the office?_

I'll message her. "Hey, are you okay? We can talk later if that is better."

_Okay, done._
