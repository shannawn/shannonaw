"Argue for your limitations and you get to keep them." - Kelly Lee Phipps

Sometimes, during hard times, I hear a voice in my mind that says "I can't". It asks someone else to do it for me. 

This voice says "I can't" more than it ever says "I can". It tells me that someone else could do it better than me. 

And by listening to the voice and letting it guide me, it creates the limitations for me. It doesn't challenge those limitations. It doesn't change those limitations into possibilities. 

It's fear led. 

And it's remarkable to me how often I find that myself suffering based on my fear. 

Don't get me wrong. I know fear is helpful. 

Fear saves lives. In prehistoric times, it was necessary for real, tangible threats like a bear, or poisonous plant. And now in a much safer world with less tangible threats, we suffer from fear transference.

We harbour the same amount of fear that we did when we experienced real, tangible threats everyday and apply them to less less tangible threats. Our fear of bears and poisonous plants is transferred to professional performance and social interactions. Because in today's society, our biggest threats to survival are financial and social debt. 

And these two threats translate to two fearful selves: Critical Striver and the Shy Pessimist. The Critical Striver's biggest fear is that I will not reach my potential. It believes that I'm not doing enough and that there's always more work to do. It doesn't believe there's time for relaxation or recovery. The Critical Striver feels like a never-ending to-do list - with all the tasks all the time constantly asking for progress updates. But the Critical Striver would tell me that it's not a never-ending to-do list with no priorities, but an organized spreadsheet with every skill I need with daily goals and progress updates.

The Shy Pessimist's biggest fear is that I'll be rejected. It believes that itâ€™s better to take up no space and be forgotten than to take up space and be disliked. It inhibits my liveliness. The Shy Pessimist feels like I'm tiny human sitting sulken trapped in a glass jar - like I'm in a the room but no one can see me and I can't participate. Think Tinkerbell in Peter Pan when no one believes in her and she's losing her ability to fly.

Both of these selves render me to a state where I'm unmotivated and ready to give up. They don't help me feel like I can reach my potential or that I can take up space. Because they're not based in hope. They're based in fear and remind me of my limitations.

And the problem with fear is that when it's not listened to, it only gets louder.

So, how can I make space to make my fears feel heard without having them set my limitations?

1. Make space for fear and limitations to be heard.
2. Validate their experiences. 
3. Show them hope and possibilities.

I curl up on the couch with my fearful selves. I make them a warm cup of team and give them a blanket. 

The Critical Striver tells me how it doesn't feel heard. It tell me that it feels like my life is spinning out of control and it makes it feel that I'm not focused on the to-do list. And I tell it that I know it's hard right now. And I point to all the moving parts of my life and how it's hard to see progress. I tell it to understand that I need relaxation and recovery in order to reach my potential. I tell it about all the times I did hard things and how I'm confident in my abilities to overcome any challenges this time too.

The Shy Pessimist tells me how it also doesn't feel heard. It tells me that we should just stay in the glass jar forever. And I take the glass jar off and hold the tiny human's hand and I tell it that I know it can be scary to put yourself out there and to try. I tell it that I need an open-mind and confidence to take up space. I tell about all the times that I did and how I felt so much better for trying than for hiding. I ask it to tell me how it might be wrong and what would happen if the reverse was true.
